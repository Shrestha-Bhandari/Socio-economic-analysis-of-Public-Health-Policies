## 💻 Project Abstract:  
<P>Public health policies play a crucial role in shaping healthcare access and outcomes, yet their socioeconomic impact is often unclear. This project leverages data science and NLP techniques to analyze how public health policies affect different socioeconomic groups. By integrating structured datasets , we aim to build an AI-driven system that evaluates policy effectiveness. A fine-tuned language model  will summarize policies, detect misinformation, and correlate policy implementation with socioeconomic indicators.


### 🫧 Background

This project investigates whether public health policies reduce or reinforce socioeconomic disparities by analyzing their intended impact, real-world effects, and public perceptions. Policies such as Medicaid expansion, vaccination programs, and mental health funding aim to improve healthcare access and outcomes, but their socioeconomic impact remains uncertain. To address this, we will analyze policy documents using NLP-based summarization to understand their objectives, leverage structured datasets (income, healthcare access, employment rates) to measure actual effects, and assess public sentiment through social media and news analysis to detect perceptions and misinformation. Finally, we will develop an AI model to correlate policies with socioeconomic indicators, generating data-driven reports and recommendations.

## High Level Requirement
<P>To effectively measure the socioeconomic impact of public health policies, the project requires a robust system integrating data acquisition, processing, and AI modeling. First, structured and unstructured data sources must be gathered, including health statistics, economic indicators, policy documents, and public sentiment data. Data processing will involve cleaning, feature engineering, and pipeline automation to ensure scalability. An LLM/SLM will be fine-tuned for policy summarization, misinformation detection, and sentiment analysis, while predictive models will assess policy effectiveness by correlating socioeconomic indicators. The system will be designed for scalability and integration, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets and adaptability for further expansion. </P>


### 📋 Functional Requirements

<P>We are currently focusing on the World Bank as our primary data source, the system must be designed to efficiently extract, preprocess, and analyze datasets available through the World Bank Open Data portal. This includes key socioeconomic indicators such as income distribution, healthcare access, employment rates, education levels, and poverty metrics. The system should support API-based data retrieval, automated updates to ensure real-time insights, and structured storage for seamless integration with our analytical models. Given the structured nature of World Bank data, preprocessing will involve handling missing values, standardizing formats, and ensuring compatibility with NLP and machine learning pipelines for summarization, comparative analysis, and predictive modeling of policy impacts. </P>
