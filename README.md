## üíª Project Abstract:  
<P>This project addresses the challenges faced by policy analysts who spend excessive time analyzing raw data by integrating AI and LLM-based techniques to evaluate public health policies. By leveraging a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.2B model and structured datasets, our system provides a scalable, evidence-driven framework that transforms complex socioeconomic data into meaningful insights. The platform enables policy analysts to quickly perform general analysis, comparative analysis, and predictive analysis of public health policies and their socioeconomic impacts, bridging the gap between policy design and on-ground realities.


### ü´ß Background

<P>Policy analysts often spend excessive time buried in raw data and documents when evaluating public health policies. The direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of these policies remain uncertain and hard to quantify using traditional methods. Our end-to-end lifecycle solution addresses this challenge by:

1. Ingesting raw data from multiple sources
2. Converting it to meaningful context for LLM learning
3. Fine-tuning LLaMA 3.2B on this specialized dataset
4. Providing an intuitive interface for general, comparative, and predictive analysis

This enables analysts to quickly detect trends, understand policy implications, and identify inequities without manual data processing. </P>


## üíª System Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Research papers
   - Census data
   - Policy outcomes

2. **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**
   - Text extraction
   - Data cleaning
   - Feature engineering
   - Training dataset creation

3. **Model Fine-tuning**
   - LLaMA 3.2B with LoRA adaptation
   - LLaMA 3.2B with QLoRA adaptation
   - Cross-encoder reranker (ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2)

4. **Evaluation & Deployment**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Perplexity, ROUGE Score, Inference Speed, Policy Relevance
   - StreamlitGradio interface for interactive use
