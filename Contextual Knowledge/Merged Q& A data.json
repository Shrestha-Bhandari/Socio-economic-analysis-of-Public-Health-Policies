      "question": "How does income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, correlate with life expectancy in the United States?",
      "answer": "Income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, shows a negative correlation with life expectancy in the United States. States and counties with higher income inequality (higher Gini coefficients) tend to have lower average life expectancies. Research suggests that a 0.05 increase in the Gini coefficient is associated with a decrease in life expectancy of approximately 0.5-1.5 years. This relationship persists even when controlling for median income, suggesting that the distribution of income, not just absolute wealth, impacts population health outcomes."
