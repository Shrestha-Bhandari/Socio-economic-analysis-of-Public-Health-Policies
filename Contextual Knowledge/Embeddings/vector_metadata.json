The goal was to determine whether a broader choice-based transfer system could be implemented effectively.  Open enrollment expansion is technically feasible but requires clear criteria for school choice and equitable access. Space availability varies by school. Transportation and funding (including vouchers) need further analysis. Autonomy for schools is seen as a potential benefit. Open enrollment expansion is a viable option if based on available space and paired with enhanced school autonomy and financial support systems.

The study reveals that Connecticut businesses have critical training needs at higher skill levels and often run in-house programs to fill gaps left by public education. It also recommends establishing a common occupational language and regular manpower needs surveys by the State Department of Labor to support career guidance and training initiatives.  Most Connecticut firms do not provide sufficient manpower needs data for long-term educational planning. Businesses lack a common occupational language, leading to inconsistent survey responses. Many firms conduct their own training programs and are critical of public vocational graduates. Career guidance in Connecticut is inadequate, and more support is needed for implementing a computer-based guidance model. The study concludes that Connecticut\u2019s workforce training gaps at higher-skill levels and inadequate career guidance could be addressed by a standardized occupational language, regular labor market surveys, and a computer-based career information system. The State should pilot and implement the proposed model using existing infrastructure and federal funds.",

This final report describes the 1975-76 activities and evaluations of Norwalk's Career Education project, covering elementary through high school levels. With goals of instilling appreciation for work and helping students identify satisfying careers, the program employed simulations, classroom integrations, resource centers, guidance activities, and community partnerships. The report offers findings, conclusions, and recommendations specific to each school level.  Career education was successfully integrated at all grade levels. Elementary teachers adopted units with varying levels of support. Middle schools implemented simulations, guidance inventories, and work-study models. High schools used aptitude tests, conferences, and resource centers. Involving classroom teachers increased program support and sustainability. The program met its goal of introducing career education at all grade levels, with teachers and administrators showing strong support. Simulated work experiences, career days, and guidance services enriched student understanding. Further updates to curriculum guides and increased principal support were recommended.",
