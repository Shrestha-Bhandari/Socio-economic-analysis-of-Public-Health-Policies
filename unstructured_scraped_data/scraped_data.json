            "Despite spending nearlytwice as muchper capita on healthcare compared to similarly large and wealthy nations, the United States has a lower life expectancy than peer nations and has seen worsening measures of health outcomes since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "This chart collection combines various measures of quality of care in the United States and other large, high-income nations (based on gross domestic product and per capita GDP) to show how the U.S. stacks up against its peers and how that has changed over time.",
            "Generally, the U.S. performs worse in long-term health outcomes measures (such as life expectancy), certain treatment outcomes (such as maternal mortality and congestive heart failure hospital admissions), some patient safety measures (such as obstetric trauma with instrument and medication or treatment errors), and patient experiences of not getting care due to cost. The U.S. performs similarly to or better than peer nations in some other measures of treatment outcomes (such as mortality rates within 30 days of acute hospital treatment) and patient safety (such as rates of post-operative sepsis).",
            "Across a wide variety of measures of quality, the U.S. health system appears to perform worse than peer nations on more indicators than it does better. However, inconsistent and imperfect metrics make it difficult to firmly assess system-wide health quality. Some measures of quality – particularly long-term measures like life expectancy – are not only reflective of the health system itself, but also of differences in socioeconomic conditions and other differences between countries that are largely outside of the domain of the health system.",

            "As discussed in more detail in aseparate brief,life expectancy at birth was similar in the U.S. and peer countries on average in 1980 (73.7 and 74.6 years, respectively), but the gap has grown substantially in the following decades as peer nations saw more rapid improvement in life expectancy. The COVID-19 pandemic further widened this gap, and life expectancy in 2022 was nearly 5 years shorter in the U.S. than in peer countries (77.5 years in the U.S. versus 82.2 years in comparable countries, on average).",
            "The above data reflect period life expectancy estimates, based on excess mortality observed in each year. The period life expectancy at birth represents the average age a cohort is hypothetically expected to live if current conditions persisted into the future, not the mortality experience of a birth cohort.",
            "All-cause mortality rates — the number of deaths per 100,000 people, adjusted for age differences across countries — plateaued in the U.S. in the 2010s, while continuing to fall in other peer nations. From 1980 to 2021 (the latest year with comparable data), the overall mortality rate from all causes of death in the U.S. fell by about 17%, compared to a 44% decline in peer countries.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased mortality in 2020 across most nations, though the U.S. saw a significantly higher increase than many other counties. Mortality rates also increased in 2021 from 2020 in the United States, despite declining in most peer nations. The gap in mortality rates between the U.S. and comparable countries, on average, was at its largest in 2021.",
            "",
            "In addition to overall mortality rates, the “years of life lost” metric marks the extent of premature deaths within a population by providing more weight to deaths at younger ages. The U.S. and comparable countries have made progress inreducing premature deathfrom 1990 to 2019 (down 24% and 42%, respectively), although the gap between the U.S. and comparable countries has increased over time.",
            "The U.S. had thehighest per capita rateof years of life lost among similarly large and wealthy countries in 2020 and 2021. The per capita premature excess death rate in the U.S. was over twice as high as the next closest peer country, the U.K. The higher rate of new premature deaths in the U.S. compared to peer countries was driven in part byracial disparitieswithin the U.S. The premature excess death rates for American Indian and Alaska Native, Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations in the U.S. were 3 times higher than the rates among White or Asian populations.",
            "Historically, the U.S. health system consistently results in higher rates ofmortality and premature deathsamong people of color.  Additionally, children and teens in the U.S. are less likely to make it to adulthood than in peer countries, with the U.S having higher rates ofmotor vehicle accidents,firearm deaths, andsuicidedeaths among children and teens.",
            "While premature death rates are a useful measure, examining disease burden can also reflect the quality of a country’s healthcare system in treating illness. Disease burden, which accounts for both premature death and years living with disability, is often measured using disability adjusted life years (DALYs).Between 1990 and 2019, the DALY ratedeclinedin the U.S. and comparable countries, though the U.S. continued to have higher age-adjusted disease burden rates than peer countries. In 2020, the DALY rate increased in the U.S. and its peer countries, reflecting a spike in mortality due to COVID-19. While, the DALY rate started to decline again, on average, in comparable countries in 2021, it continued to increase in the U.S. In 2021, the DALY rate was 46% higher in the U.S. than in comparable countries, on average.",

            "Mortality within 30 days of being admitted to a hospital is not entirely preventable, but high quality of care can reduce the mortality rate for certain diagnoses. The 30-day mortality rates after hospital admissions for heart attacks (acute myocardial infarction) and hemorrhagic stroke (caused by bleeding) are similar in the U.S. and comparable countries average. The 30-day mortality rates for ischemic strokes (caused by blood clots) was 4.3 deaths per 100 patients in the U.S. in 2020, compared to an average of 6.2 deaths per 100 patients in similar countries. While the U.S. has lower rates of mortality due to these conditions than the average across peer nations, it is important to note that several individual peer nations have lower mortality rates than the U.S.",
            "While wealth and economic prosperity are highly correlated with lower maternal mortality rates, the U.S. is an outlier with the highest rate of pregnancy-related deaths (22.3 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022) when compared to peer countries (3.9 deaths per 100,000 live births).",
            "Within the U.S., there are significant racial disparities in maternal mortality rates. The maternal mortality rate for Black mothers is significantly higher than the rate for White mothers — a disparity that persists acrossage and socioeconomic groups. Every race and ethnicity, socioeconomic, and age group in the United States sees higher maternal mortality rates than the average in comparable countries. Maternal mortality in the U.S.has risensince the mid-2010s, sparking concern from the medical community and regulators.",

            "Hospital admissions for certain chronic diseases, such as cardiac conditions, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), asthma, and diabetes, can arise for a variety of reasons, but access to and use of primary care and preventive services can play a role in preventing some admissions.",
            "Hospital admission rates in the U.S. are higher than in comparable countries for congestive heart failure and complications due to diabetes, and some admissions for these chronic conditions could be minimized with adequate primary care. Admission rates in 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic — patients were less likely to seek hospital treatment, and hospitals were at times overwhelmed and unable to admit patients who would have been admitted in a different year.",
            "Cesarean sections are one of the mostcommonlyperformed surgical procedures in the U.S. and have become a key indicator of quality of care in maternal health. Cesarean sections can be lifesaving — however, when they are not medically indicated, they can pose unnecessaryrisksfor mothers, including an increased chance of blood clots, infections, and other complications that require further surgery.",
            "The U.S. has consistently had higher cesarean section rates than most of its peers, though rates have plateaued slightly in recent years. In 2021, the rate of cesarean sections per 1,000 live births was 321 in the U.S. and an average of 242 in comparable countries.",
            "Obstetric trauma is more likely to occur in deliveries where medical instruments are utilized (i.e., forceps). The rate of obstetric trauma during deliveries with an instrument in the U.S. was 11.7 per 100 vaginal deliveries in 2020, higher than most comparable countries with available data. The rate of obstetric trauma during deliveries without an instrument in the U.S. was 1.7 per 100 vaginal deliveries in 2020, on the lower end among comparable countries with available data.",
            "",
            "Rates of post-operative complications are an important measure of hospital safety. Pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis can arise as  complications from surgeries or extended hospital stays. The prevalence of post-operative clots for these procedures is higher in the U.S. than in the U.K., Sweden, Belgium, and the Netherlands, but lower than in Australia.",
            "Sepsis is a serious complication for patients with infections, and effects can range from organ failure and shock to death in severe cases. Rates of post-operative infections and sepsis are an important marker of care quality for patients undergoing surgery, because this is a major source of morbidity and mortality that can sometimes be prevented. Prevention is multifactorial and can involve proper operative techniques and training, hygiene and safety protocols, and antibiotic utilization, amongst other things. The rate of post-operative sepsis following abdominal surgery is just under 2% in the U.S., lower than in most peer countries that report data.",
            "Patients in the U.S. are more likely than those in comparable countries to report experiencing a medication or medical error at some point during their care, according to asurveyby the Commonwealth Fund. In this case, medication errors include being given the wrong medication or dose, and treatment errors indicate that people thought a medical mistake had been made in their treatment or care. In 2020, 12.6% of patients in the U.S. reported experiencing a medical error compared to 11.4% of patients in similar countries.",
            "Unintentionally retained items or device fragments following surgical procedures can result in pain, infection and evenlife-threatening consequencesfor patients. The U.S. has the lowest rate of retained surgical items or unretrieved device fragments in 2020, at 1.6 per 100,000 surgical hospital discharges, compared to an average rate of 8.2 per 100,000 surgical hospital discharges in comparable countries.",
            "Patients in the U.S. are more likely to report missing consultations with their provider due to costs. In 2020, the share of the population (as measured by rate per 100 patients) reporting missing a consultation due to cost was 26.8% in the U.S., compared to and average of 7.0% among comparable countries. When patients choose not to meet with their physicians due to cost or any other reason, it can lead to worse health outcomes and more expensive care needed at later points in the patient’s life.  Healthcare utilizationfell in 2020due to the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare resources were diverted to COVID-19 related care, normal care was paused temporarily, and appointments were delayed or forgone.",
            "Most data used here are sourced from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which compiles health quality statistics and data from member nations. Comparable countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
            "All cause age-adjusted mortality data is unavailable for Australia in 2005. Belgium, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom are excluded from the comparable country average rate for all cause age-adjusted mortality for all years due to unavailable data in 2021.",
            "Age-standardized 30-day mortality rate datafor acute myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke, ages 45 and older, is unavailable for France, Germany, and Switzerland in 2020.",
            "Age-standardized hospital admission rate data for COPD and congestive heart failure is unavailable for Japan in 2020. Age-standardized hospital admission rate data for COPD, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and asthma are unavailable for France and Germany in 2020.",

            "C-section data is not available for Belgium and Sweden from 2000-2004 and Switzerland from 2000-2001. Data for the Netherlands in 2011 is missing and instead interpolated from 2010. Data for Belgium in 2015 is missing and instead interpolated from 2014. For countries without both an inpatient and day case C-section rate, the inpatient rate is used. Australia, Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom are excluded from the comparable country average for all years due to a lack of 2021 data.",
            "Throughout this chart collection, measures such as long-term health outcomes, treatment outcomes, hospital-related care, and patient safety are used to analyze the quality of health systems in the U.S. and 11 other countries identified as similarly wealthy based on total GDP and GDP per capita. While these indicators allow for cross-country comparisons, they do not necessarily provide a comprehensive overview of the quality of each country’s respective health system. Country-specific differences in population health, payment systems, survey metrics/methods, and demographics present barriers to cross country comparisons.",

            "GLP-1 agonists have been used as a treatment for type 2 diabetes for nearly two decades. Recently, newer forms of these drugs, such as Wegovy (semaglutide), have gained widespread attention as a treatment for obesity and weight-related comorbidities.",
            "As the potential uses of these drugs expand, such as withrecent approvalsto prevent heart attacks and strokes in adults with cardiovascular disease who are overweight, thehigh costand increased demand for these drugs may increase health spending. To date, these GLP-1 drugs have been approved to treat three adult populations: individuals with type 2 diabetes, individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater (obesity), and individuals with a BMI between 27 and 30 (overweight) with at least one weight-related health condition, such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, prior stroke, prior heart attack, and chest pain (angina).",
            "In annual filings to state regulators for plan year 2025, someinsurerscited increases in utilization of GLP-1 drugs as a contributor to rising premiums. Many ACA Marketplaceplansmanage the costs associated with GLP-1 drugs by only covering them for diabetes treatment and not for weight management.",
            "This analysis estimates clinical eligibility and use of GLP-1 drugs among adults under age 65 in the private and employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) markets using the 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Merative MarketScan commercial claims data. The private insurance market represents thelargest shareof the insured population (66% of all people in 2022) in the United States. The private market is defined here as anyone under age 65 who received insurance from their employer, union, professional organization, direct purchase, online exchange, or school, as well as through parents or another relative who received insurance from a prior listed source.",
            "These broad estimates indicate the potential number of non-elderly adults who meet the clinical criteria for GLP-1 drugs, although employers and insurers may have more restrictive eligibility standards for coverage. Additionally, because many people with diabetes or who are overweight may control their condition with diet, other medications and therapies, or choose to not seek treatment, not all people who meet these clinical criteria would use GLP-1 drugs. This analysis of survey data finds that over 40% of adults under 65 with private insurance could be indicated for a GLP-1 drug though relatively few have a claim, suggesting that a much smaller share seeks treatment through healthcare providers. Therefore, the potential market size for GLP-1 drugs suggests the broadest possible impacts on private insurancepremiumsand health system spending.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "Over 2 in 5 (42%) adults under 65 with private insurance could be eligible for GLP-1 drugs, based on current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Non-elderly adults who are obese make up the largest share of those clinically eligible in the private insurance market: 45.8 million people or 80% of those indicated as possibly eligible in the private market are obese, of which 41.8 million people are indicated based on obesity alone. Over ten million people are eligible because of a combination of being overweight and having ever been told that they have another weight-related risk factor.",
            "Among non-elderly adults with ESI (estimated to be 116.8 million from NHIS), 42%, or 49.3 million people, are clinically eligible for GLP-1 drugs; 36.2 million people with ESI are potentially eligible for GLP-1 drugs based on an obesity diagnosis alone. Similar shares of those with employer-sponsored coverage are potentially eligible for a GLP-1 antagonist as private coverage overall.  For more information on those covered by an employer plan see the appendix.",
            "In setting their coverage requirements, employers will weigh the cost of these drugs against the clinical benefits and demands from their workers and may impose additional eligibility conditions for prescription drug coverage. People who are obese (have a BMI greater than or equal to 30) are clinically eligible for GLP-1 drugs, but employer plans may set additional BMI requirements to cover GLP-1 drug use under obesity. Currently, drugs that are approved solely forobesity treatmenthave minimal to no coverage on ACA Marketplace plans. Surveyresultsindicate that many employer plans require employees to complete a case management program or otherutilization managementsteps before covering GLP-1 drugs.",
            "Other employer plans may only cover GLP-1 drugs for some conditions, or not at all. Employers may also consider setting a higher body mass index (BMI) threshold for coverage eligibility, such as at 35 (class II obesity) or 40 (class III obesity). Even if employers adopted a BMI threshold of 35 or greater, 13% (14.6 million) of adults under 65 covered by an employer plan would exceed this threshold. With a cutoff of a BMI of 40, 3% (3.6 million) of adults with employer-sponsored insurance would still qualify.",
            "Since 2012, the share of non-elderly adults with ESI that have a GLP-1 drug claim has grown more than eightfold (717.7% increase). However, only about 3% had at least one claim in 2022. Semaglutide—sold as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus—quickly rose to become the most common GLP-1 drug prescribed since its introduction to market in 2018. Additionally, older GLP-1 drugs, such as exenatide, have seen a decline in claims since the early 2010s as newer drugs were introduced.",
            "While there was a substantial increase over the ten-year period between 2012 and 2022, some evidence indicates that utilization has only continued to rise over the last two years, beyond the most recent claims data available. According toKFF pollingfrom May 2024, 6% of all adults report that they currently are taking a GLP-1 drug, and 12% report that they’ve ever taken a GLP-1 drug.",
            "To determine insurance market enrollment, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)hierarchyfor primary coverage among people under age 65 was used. Employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) was determined if private insurance enrollees stated that they were not enrolled in Medicare and reported receiving coverage through parents or from an employer, union, or professional organization.",
            "Clinical eligibility for GLP-1 drugs was determined using BMI and the following comorbidities as specified in NHIS: coronary heart disease, prior stroke, prior heart attack, angina, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. For each condition, respondents answered whether they were ever told by a doctor or healthcare professional if they had the condition; those who responded that they did not know were counted as not having the condition. All answers are self-reported and may underestimate prevalence of clinical conditions. Respondents were included as having diabetes if they stated that they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had type 2 diabetes or did not know their specific type of diabetes (those with type 1 diabetes and “other type of diabetes” were excluded).",
            "FDA approval to use GLP-1 drugs for weight loss specifies that those who have a BMI between 27 and 30 must have another weight-related condition, such as those listed above. Because NHIS does not include information on all weight-related conditions—such as obstructive sleep apnea, peripheral arterial disease, and aortic atherosclerosis—the number and share of the private and ESI markets indicated for GLP-1 drugs are potentially underestimated among those who are overweight. However, given the frequent co-occurrence of the omitted conditions and those included in this analysis, the number and share excluded may be small.",
            "BMI is calculated from a respondent’s self-reported height and weight. NHIS redacts height outside the range of 63-76 inches for men and 59-70 inches for women. Similarly for weight, NHIS redacts values outside the range of 126-299 pounds for men and 100-274 pounds for women. The proportions of those with employer-sponsored insurance eligible at different cutoffs of BMI were estimated using only respondents with unredacted values for height and weight and extrapolated to the entire obese population.",
            "To find the proportion of ESI enrollees with a prescription for GLP-1 drugs, outpatient pharmaceutical claims from 2012 to 2022 in the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database were used. MarketScan contains claims information provided by a sample of large employer plans, made representative of the ESI market by using weights to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of 1,000 or more workers, adjusting by sex, age, and state. The analysis included all adults aged 18 to 64 who had continuous enrollment in their plan for more than 6 months. GLP-1 drugs were identified using RxNav and RxClass from theNational Library of Medicine, selecting all drugs within the Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Agonists (N0000020058) Mechanism of Action class.",

            "Most adults (91%) have health insurance, and the majority (85% of adults) self-report their health status as at least good. However, many adults face barriers accessing medical care. High cost-sharing and expenses not covered by insurance leave some with expensive medical bills. Many adults face additional barriers accessing needed healthcare. Long appointment wait times, difficulty finding in-network providers and challenges traveling to providers at convenient times may lead some to delay or skip care.",
            "This chart collection examines barriers that impact access to health care in the U.S. using the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The survey asked adults whether they delayed or did not get medical care during the preceding 12 months. This analysis focuses on four access challenges, including difficulties finding a doctor who accepts insurance, finding an available appointment, getting to the provider or clinic when they were open and travel times to the provider. (Additionally, findings on the challenges making time to seek services are reported separately.) These non-financial barriers may originate for various reasons, including narrow plan networks, provider workforce shortages, and challenges balancing work schedules.",
            "More than 1 in 4 adults (28%) reported delaying or going without either medical care, prescription drugs, mental health care, or dental care due to cost in 2022. Fifteen percent of adults reported foregoing medical care, prescription drugs, or mental health care due to cost.",
            "While cost can present a significant access barrier, other barriers to care may be consequential for people’s access. As shown in the following charts, the impact of these barriers may vary with one’s age, insurance type, and health needs.",
            "Overall, 17% of adults under the age of 65 experienced at least one access to care barrier in 2022 aside from cost. Of the reported reasons, 12% said it was because a doctor’s appointment wasn’t available, 5% said it was because they couldn’t find a doctor that accepted their insurance, 5% said it was because they couldn’t get to the doctor’s office or clinic when it was open, and 3% said it was because it took too long to get to the doctor’s office or clinic from their house or work.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Adults aged 18 to 64 years old are more likely to encounter one of these access barriers than adults aged 65 years and older. On average, 17% of adults aged 18 to 29, 17% of those aged 30 to 49 years old, and 15% of those aged 50 to 54 years old, cite at least one of the above access barriers. By contrast, older adults, aged 65 years and older, are less likely to report an access barrier (10%).",
            "Work, child-care and other commitments can reduce the amount of time individuals have available to prioritize medical care. In addition, NHIS asked whether adults had delayed care during the preceding 12 months because they were too busy with work or other commitments to take the time. Young and middle-aged adults are more likely to report that there was a time they delayed care because they were too busy with work or other commitments to take the time; (17% for those 18-29 years old and 18% for those 30-49 years old versus 3% for those 65 years and older). Including challenges making the time to seek care, a total of 22% of adults and 24% of non-elderly adults reported at least one access to care barrier.",
            "Non-financial barriers to health care are less common among adults ages 65 and older than among younger adults. Virtually all people ages 65 and older are covered by Medicare, either traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage. Most traditional Medicare beneficiaries have an additional supplementalsource of coverage, such as Medicaid, retiree health benefits, or Medigap. Beneficiaries in traditional Medicare have access to a relatively broad choice of physicians and other health care providers, whileMedicare Advantageenrollees are limited to in-network providers or pay more to see out-of-network providers. In general, Medicare beneficiaries reporthigheror similar access than those on other forms of coverage. Given the higher share of non-elderly people reporting access barriers in NHIS, the charts that follow focus on adults between the ages 18 and 64 years old.",
            "The types of barriers faced by adults vary by their coverage. This may reflect both differences in the characteristics of people enrolled in different types of coverage, and differences in the plans themselves. Adults enrolled in Medicaid are more likely to face access barriers than those with another form of coverage. Among adults enrolled in Medicaid, 24% reported at least one of the above four access to care barriers, compared to 18% for those on non-group coverage, and 15% for those covered by an employer-sponsored insurance plan.",
            "In both non-group plans, such as Marketplace, and Medicaid plans, a larger proportion of individuals reported difficulty finding a doctor who accepted their coverage compared to those with employer sponsored plans. Additionally, over 10% of enrollees across coverage types said they had to delay or skip care because appointments were not available. These higher shares may reflect limited provider networks available to many Medicaid and Marketplace enrollees. Plans vary in the breadth of provider networks, with some using relatively narrow networks to reduce cost. The health coverage for those covered by Medicaid may be managed by a Medicaid Managed Care organization, which establish provider networks and may require enrollees obtain referrals to see specialists. In other cases, Medicaid beneficiaries may not have provider networks, but may have a limited choice of providers who accept Medicaid.",
            "Access barriers can reflect the socioeconomic status and health profiles of enrollees rather than intentional features of plan design. For instance, Medicaid beneficiaries generally have lower incomes and higher rates of chronic illness compared to those with private insurance coverage. Additionally, higher shares of those on Medicaid do not have access to avehicle, and may face more challenges getting to a doctor’s office, as well as affording child care.",
            "While Medicaid enrollees encounter more non-financial access barriers, enrollees areless likelyto report cost-related insurance problems than those with non-group coverage and ESI. For example, those on Medicaid are less likely to report that their insurance did not pay for care they received that they thought was covered than those on an employer-sponsored plan or the Marketplaces (12% vs. 21% and 20%). Looking at other measures of healthcare access,similar sharesof adults enrolled in Medicaid and those with private insurance do not have a usual source of care.",
            "While virtually everyone uses healthcare services during their lifetime, many people use no services in any given year. People requiring care use their coverage more often and are more likely to encounter challenges accessing care. Among non-elderly adults who went to a hospital or an emergency room in 2022, 26% reported at least one of the above access to care barriers. Additionally, 19% of those who visited an emergency room or hospital in the past year reported that a doctor’s appointment was not available, and 8% reported that they were unable to find a doctor that takes their insurance.",
            "The likelihood of encountering an access barrier varies for non-elderly adults with different insurance coverages. Among those who visited an emergency room or were admitted to the hospital, Medicaid enrollees were the most likely to report one of the listed access to care barriers (34%).",
            "Demand for mental health servicesincreasedduring the pandemic,exacerbatinglong standing shortages of mental health care providers. In many areas, there are not enough mental health providers to meet thedemandfor services. A higher share of those in treatment for a mental health conditionencounterone of the listedaccess barriers. Amongadults under 65who received counseling or therapy from a mental health professional in the previous 12 months,29%encounteredat least oneof the aboveaccess barriers, compared to14%among those who did notreceive mental healththerapy.Similarly, those who took a prescription medication to help with concentration, behavior or mental health during the prior 12 monthsaremore likely to face an access barrier (28% vs.16%).Forsomeof these patients, these access to care barriers stem from insufficient networkcoverage of mental health serviceswithintheirhealth insurance plan.If plans do not cover a broad spectrum of mental health professionals, it can be difficult for patients to findaffordable doctors with available appointments.Among those who received counseling or therapy from a mental health professional in the previous 12 months,20% reported appointments not being available,compared to10% among those who did not.In addition,11% of those whotooka mental health related prescription in the last 12 monthswere unable to find a doctor that accepts their insurance, compared to 5% who did not.",
            "Those in poor health may require more frequent access to health care facilities for timely treatment and management of their conditions. Individuals who reported having fair or poor health were more likely to report facing an access barrier. Of non-elderly adults with fair or poor health, 28% reported at least one of the listed access barriers while 15% of adults in very good or excellent health reported an access barrier. Individuals in fair/poor health were more likely to encounter difficulties in traveling to provider’s office as well, either due to it taking too long to travel there or being unable to go during operating hours (7% and 11% respectively).",
            "",
            "Skipping and delaying needed health services may have detrimental health consequences. For many, barriers to accessing care extend beyond the cost of medical services. A comprehensive understanding of healthcare access requires considering non-financial obstacles that lead people to skip care.Social determinantsof health, including income, may impact an individual’s ability to obtain medical care.",
            "The National Health Interview Survey is a cross-sectional household interview survey that uses geographically clustered sampling techniques to select the sample of dwelling units. One “sample adult” and one “sample child” (if applicable) are randomly chosen from each household. For this analysis, only the adult interview data was used. The sample is the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States.  More information on NHIS can be foundhere.",

            "This chart collection examines recent trends in healthcare utilization and spending using a variety of data sources. Together, these data suggest that, as of the first quarter of 2024, most spending on health services exceeds pre-pandemic levels and health costs are growing at a faster rate than in recent years.  However, utilization of care has been uneven by setting and market. Some measures of hospital utilization remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, which could reflect a continuing transition of care tooutpatient centers.",
            "",
            "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many outpatient visits and elective hospitalizations were delayed, avoided, or cancelled, leading to a sharp decline in healthcareutilization.",
            "Since early 2022, though, year-over-year growth in health services spending rebounded as the health system recovered from the initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the growth in spending reflects rising prices, as inflation and workforce shortages have put upward pressure on hospital prices.",
            "After some volatility in 2020 through 2022, growth in hospital services spending has been consistently high, with double digit growth since early 2023. Similarly, growth in nursing and residential care facilities spending has ranged from 10.0% to 13.4% year-over-year since the beginning of 2023.",
            "The number of hospital discharges in the first quarter of 2024 remained below the number of quarterly discharges in the years leading up to the pandemic. In 2018 and 2019, the number of hospital discharges each quarter ranged from just under 9.7 million to over 9.8 million.  In the early pandemic, the number dropped as low as 8.0 million discharges. By the first quarter of 2024, the number of hospital discharges had rebounded to 9.3 million, but that was still about 0.5 million short of the typical number of discharges in 2018 and 2019.",
            "According to data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), the number of inpatient admissions per capita has been trending downward over the past two decades. There has been a move from inpatient settings to outpatient care centers for some types of care, such as imaging and diagnostic services and less complex surgical procedures.",

            "Health Spending",
            "Hospitalization trends differ by insurance market. In recent years, there have been declines in per enrollee Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage inpatient admissions. These data do not include traditional Medicare enrollees, nor do they include enrollees in state-run Medicaid plans, and these trends could reflect shifts in the underlying health status of enrollees in privately administered plans.",
            "In contrast, the average number of inpatient admissions per enrollee in the individual and fully-insured group plans remained relatively stable.",
            "The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) early release estimates provide a look at how visits to hospital emergency departments and doctor’s offices have changed from 2019 through the first quarter of 2024. Because the survey asks about utilization in the past year, though, it may mask volatility in utilization from month to month.",
            "The share of adults with a visit to a hospital emergency department appears to be similar to pre-pandemic levels. The share of adults reporting an emergency department visit in the previous 12 months dropped from about 22.2% in the first quarter of 2019 to 17.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The share of adults reporting a visit to an emergency department in the past year has since rebounded, with 20.7% of adults reporting a visit in the first quarter of 2024.",
            "The number of hospital outpatient visits per capita has been trending upward over time. This has coincided with a decline in hospital inpatient admissions.",
            "From 2000 to 2023, there was a 31% increase in the rate of outpatient visits. From 2019-2020, there was a nearly 10% decrease as care was delayed, foregone, or cancelled due to the COVID-19. The rate of outpatient visits has since recovered and in 2023 was marginally above pre-pandemic levels.",
            "The share of adults with a doctor visit in the last year has recovered since 2020 and is similar to pre-pandemic levels. In the first quarter of 2019, over 85.3% of adults reported going to a doctor in the previous 12 months. The share of adults who had a doctor visit decreased in 2020 and reached the lowest level in the first quarter of 2021 with 80.1% of adults having seen a doctor in the prior year. In the most recent quarter with available data, the first quarter of 2024, this share rose slightly to just over 85.0%.",
            "The average number of ambulatory encounters per enrollee in Medicare Advantage has grown in recent years, whereas the number of ambulatory care encounters per Medicaid enrollee has fallen since pre-pandemic. Ambulatory care utilization in the individual and fully-insured group markets has held relatively steady.",
            "We analyzed insurer-reported financial data (accessed June 11, 2024) from Health Coverage PortalTM, a market database maintained by Mark Farrah Associates, which includes information from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). We used the “Exhibit of Premiums, Enrollment, and Utilization” report for this analysis. The dataset analyzed in this report does not include California HMOs regulated by California’s Department of Managed Health Care. Additionally, for Medicaid, there are five states (Arizona, California, Delaware, New York, and Oregon) that have different reporting practices and therefore consistently only have partial or no NAIC data available.",
            "We excluded plans that file negative values in any of the segments of interest or have negative or zero dollars in premiums or claims. We also excluded plans reporting at least 1,000 hospital patient days incurred per 1,000 member months. We only included plans that were categorized as having a “medical” focus in our analysis and exclude “specialty” plans which are categorized as “ancillary or supplemental benefit plans.” We also excluded any plans from the U.S. territories. We corrected for plans that did not file “member months” or filed a zero “member month” value but did file quarterly or current year membership by inputting these values. If, after imputing, plans still did not have “member months,” they were excluded. Group market refers to fully insured group plans. “All Markets” is a weighted average of the individual, fully insured group, Medicaid managed care, and Medicare Advantage markets.",
            "We excluded plans that did not file complete 2024 Q1 statements with the NAIC as of June 6, 2024, in other quarters. Additionally, we excluded plans that reported outlier per member per month values. The spike in the Individual market in the first quarter of 2023 is driven by data anomalies in two insurers.",

            "Electronic consults (or eConsults) are a technology solution that enables clinicians to connect with specialists on timely patient care questions. This bi-directional, tech-enabled communication, often initiated by primary care or emergency room physicians to specialists, empowers the initiating clinician with efficient access to specialist expertise to manage a diagnosis and provide oversight of a patient’s care. While it is considered best practice for primary care providers to discuss the eConsult process with their patients, this is done inconsistently.  In the absence of an eConsult, patients are typically referred to additional, higher intensity services or specialists for care, where patients can experience increased costs and wait times for appointments due to specialist access constraints. In recent years, eConsults have been an integral component of care transformation initiatives across public payer populations, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Studies of those initiatives demonstrate eConsults role in lowering costs, improving quality, and enhancing patient and provider experiences.[1]",
            "The Peterson Center on Healthcare (The Center) is a non-profit organization dedicated to making higher quality, more affordable healthcare a reality for all Americans. In 2021, the Center launched a pilot in partnership with the largest commercial payer in Arkansas (Arkansas BlueCross BlueShield (ARBCBS)) to assess whether the positive impact that eConsults derive in public programs could be replicated in a commercially insured population. Over a period of 18 months, the pilot funded access to, training for, and reimbursement of eConsults in eight independent physician groups and 19 health system practices in Arkansas.[2]",
            "In the pilot, eConsults saved an average of $195 per month among participating commercially insured patients, driven primarily by a decrease in specialty care expenditures. While the savings are promising, utilization of the technology was underwhelming, concentrated among a small handful of independent practices. Lessons learned from the pilot can inform future efforts to encourage eConsult adoption.",
            "Arkansas was selected for the pilot for several reasons: it is a rural state with specialist access constraints;[3]it is a state with a history of participating in primary care practice transformation efforts offered by CMS;[4]and partnership with a large commercial payer ensured access to commercially insured lives that sought care from the participating primary care practice sites.",
            "The eight independent physician groups and 19 health system practices received seed funding to cover staff time for training and integration of eConsults into existing technology and workflows. The pilot reimbursed primary and specialty care providers across all populations to encourage participation in eConsults. Physician reimbursement differed between the independent and health system clinicians. The health system decided on a 0.5 relative value unit (RVU) credit (a measure of work that is used in health care organizations and by payers to determine health care provider compensation or payment)[5]per eConsult to both requesting PCPs and responding specialists to allow the eConsult activity to meet minimum productivity levels. Each independent practice was paid $40 per PCP eConsult.[6]",

            "EConsult vendors were distinct between the health system and independent practices, a purposeful design decision that acknowledges the inherent structural differences between large health systems and independent practices. More specifically, the health system technology created a “home-grown” eConsult network, leveraging their own clinicians. The technology was embedded into the electronic health record (EHR) and, over time, included 13 specialties[7]that could be accessed via eConsult within the health system. In contrast, for the independent practices, the eConsult vendor offered a “plug and play” solution—the technology integrated into existing referral workflows and provided immediate access to a national network of 23 specialties[8]employed by the eConsult vendor.",
            "To build staff capacity, health system leaders introduced eConsults in provider meetings and created training guides and tip sheets. For independent physician group practices, the eConsult service provider held virtual meetings to train key personnel from each practice, who then shared the information and organized a training process for their practice (a concept known as “train the trainer”). The vendor also provided an instructional video on how to use eConsults and links to additional resources to assist staff who were not part of the initial meetings.",
            "Detail on the pilot structure and implementation can be found in the table below:",
            "The evaluation found eConsults had a positive impact on cost reduction. On average, patients that received an eConsult saved $195 overall compared to patients that did not receive an eConsult (Graph 1). Savings were primarily driven by a decrease in specialty care expenditures resulting from the lower cost of the eConsult ($50) compared to an in-person specialty visit (mean expenses across specialty types range from $159 to $419[9]).  On average, patients that received an eConsult saved $184 on specialty visits compared to patients that did not receive an eConsult (Chart 1).  Emergency department visits following eConsult were highly similar in the treatment and control groups, suggesting eConsults did not impact patient access to these types of services or increase adverse events. These findings are consistent with those observed in other studies.[10]",
            "Two independent group practices (sites IND-1 and IND-2, inChart 2)were responsible for more than 50% of all eConsult utilization in the pilot (total = 1,042 eConsults). Excluding the two highest utilizers, the remaining top eight utilizers (n=14) averaged 27 eConsults per practice over 18 months for independent group practices and 12 months for health system practices.",
            "Independent group practices utilized eConsults more than their health system counterparts, exceeding projected expectations by 25% (Chart 3).  Health System practices, on the other hand, fell below projected expectations by 43% (Chart 3). Rollout of eConsults took longer in the health system, due to the EHR integration and measured pace of specialty rollout, which played a role in the health system’s lower-than-expected utilization.",
            "The Arkansas eConsult pilot offers useful insights on the opportunities and challenges to deploying promising technologies like eConsults. EConsults can reduce spending in commercial populations without negatively impacting quality, and thus the technology holds great potential to improve the affordability and efficiency of the healthcare system with broader adoption.",
            "The pilot was designed to remove common barriers to adoption[11]—it supplied capital to acquire new technology, workflow implementation support, technical assistance, and clinician reimbursement. Furthermore, the eConsult vendor selection was tailored to meet the distinct organizational needs of the health system and independent physician group practices.",
            "Although the pilot sought to mitigate implementation challenges in both independent and system settings, utilization remained low, and two independent practices drove the vast majority of utilization. What differentiated these two practices from the others? Of the many plausible explanations, buy-in and engagement in the eConsult program from practice leadership emerged as a key differentiator. Leaders at these two practices translated the value of the technology to the work they do serving patients and identified it as a helpful tool to leverage in value-based care insurance arrangements. Practice leaders were able to make a connection between the use of eConsults and practice success in meeting the goals of those arrangements.[12]Because of this, practice leadership emphasized the role of eConsults in enhancing patient experience, addressing access issues, and increasing clinical knowledge; further, they set targets for its use, which they monitored regularly.",
            "Acquiring and implementing new technology into clinical workflows is expensive, time-intensive, and requires cross-functional teams to execute. That the technology is cost-saving, can alleviate specialist access challenges and improves patient experience is important, but it is not enough to seed and accelerate adoption. Changes to clinical workflows and practice patterns take time and require sustained buy-in from leaders. Clear and sustained articulation of the benefits of eConsults across perspectives is crucial. An appreciation of the complexity of change management within healthcare settings is paramount, and tailored, continuous technical assistance to implementing organizations is required.",
            "To further advance eConsult usage, understanding the practice patterns and financial incentives of participating providers is crucial. Even with the proliferation of accountable care and value-based care contracts, health systems continue to rely heavily on procedure-based interventions conducted by specialists to achieve their margins. Implementing a technology solution like eConsults, that has the potential to reduce specialist visits, challenges this business model. For independent physicians, financial incentives to use eConsults may be more readily apparent, but more could be done to explicitly connect their utility to performing well under various value-based care contracts across payers.",

            "Costs and affordability of retail prescription drugs have become increasingly important issues for consumers, healthcare providers, and policymakers alike. PreviousKFF polling in 2023showed that 82% of U.S. adults think the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, with 3 in every 4 adults agreeing that there is not as much regulation as there should be to limit prescription drug prices.",
            "TheInflation Reduction Act of 2022incorporates several provisions aimed at both reducing out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for individuals with Medicare and lowering federal Medicare spending on prescription drugs, including a provision that requires the federal government to negotiate prices for specified high- expenditure drugs — first for Medicare Part D drugs (starting in 2026) and later for Medicare Part B drugs (starting in 2028). (Part D covers retail outpatient prescription drugs and Part B covers physician-administered drugs.) InAugust 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released the list of the firstten drugsthat were selected for Medicare price negotiations. The next key deadline for CMS is to publish the negotiated maximum fair drug prices bySeptember 1, 2024.",
            "Although the Inflation Reduction Act enacted into law included drug-related policies that primarily affect Medicare,earlier drafts of the legislationincluded similar provisions that would have applied to the private insurance market, including making the government’s negotiated price available to both Medicare and private payers. This analysis uses the Merative MarketScan 2022 commercial claims to estimate the number of enrollees in the employer-sponsored insurance market who use one or more of the ten drugs selected for Medicare Part D price negotiations.",
            "Among the 167 million people with employer-sponsored insurance in 2022,3.4 million peopleused at least one of the ten drugs that have been identified for Medicare price negotiations.",
            "The number of employer plan enrollees taking a given drug varies greatly. The most common was Jardiance, a drug used to treat diabetes and heart failure, with over 911,000 enrollees; the least common was Imbruvica, a drug used to treat blood cancers with only 5,000 enrollees.",

            "Health Spending",
            "Overall, fewer enrollees in the employer-sponsored market use at least one of the ten drugs slated for negotiation than in the Medicare Part D population, where7.7 millionenrollees took at least one of the ten drugs in 2022. On a drug-by-drug basis, all of the drugs except Stelara and Enbrel were used by fewer enrollees in the employer market than in Medicare.",
            "Of note, this analysis does not include an estimate of the number of people with health insurance through ACA marketplace plans who also take these drugs.",
            "In the future, the Medicare program will select additional drugs for negotiation, with another 15 Part D drugs selected for 2027, 15 Part D and Part B drugs selected for 2028, and another 20 Part B and Part D drugs selected for 2029 and future years. It is therefore likely that millions more people with private coverage will use at least one of the additional drugs slated for Medicare negotiation in the future.",
            "It isunclearhow lowering drug prices in Medicare may impact prices in the private insurance market. Some think the negotiated Medicare prices will serve as abenchmarkfor private insurers during negotiations with drug manufacturers and thus potentially decrease prices, while others are concerned that there will be“cost shifting”from Medicare to private payers, causing increased prices.Othershave advocated for expanding the drug-related provisions of the IRA to include the private market.",
            "Outpatient pharmaceutical claims from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database were used to estimate the number of enrollees who, in 2022, had taken a drug that will be included in the Medicare price negotiations. These data include claims from both retail and mail-order pharmacies. We included all individuals who were ever enrolled in 2022 (i.e., enrolled during at least one month of the year). To make MarketScan data nationally representative, weights were applied to match counts in theCurrent Population Surveyby sex, age, and state, and included individuals with an employer-sponsored plan as either primary or secondary coverage.  The total of all weighted enrollees in 2022 was 167 million. This estimate includes people with dual coverage, and as a result, is higher than the totals publishedhere.  To identify claims for the drugs selected for Medicare negotiations, we used the National Drug Codes (NDCs) that CMS published and are available for downloadhere.",

            "Health insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small, butgrowing, share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans). However, these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.",
            "For 2025, across 324 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 7%, which is similar tolast year. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from insurers in 10 states and DC, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, some insurers also mention increased utilization of weight loss and other specialty drugs as influencing premiums. Pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage are having little, if any, impact on individual market premiums for 2025.",
            "Among the 324 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of -14% to an increase of 51%, but most proposed premium changes for 2025 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 324 insurer filings, 50 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 85 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2025 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.",
            "There are a number of ways to assess premium changes in this market. In this analysis, a premium increase for a given insurer is its weighted average percent change across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes differ from the percent change in thebenchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. For context, the median proposed rate increase was 6% in2024, while the average increase in benchmark silver premiums was5%in 2024.  The vast majority of enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. Nonetheless, premium increases generally result in higher federal spending on subsidies.",
            "Figure 1 above shows premium changes for 324 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (61 insurers across 10 states and DC), which we review in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2025. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, across the 10 states and DC reviewed in this section, insurers have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.",

            "Medical trend, the growth in cost and utilization of healthcare services and medication, continues to be a prominent driver of premium changes in 2025. This year, increases in the prices insurers are paying for medical care tend to play a larger role in premium growth than growth in the utilization of care. Of the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail from 10 states and DC with publicly quantified annualized medical trend, the median medical trend was 8%, with most insurers having a trend of around 7-10%. In most years,medical inflationtypically outpaces general economic inflation, but through much of 2021 to 2023, inflation in the rest of the economy was so high that it was outpacing growth in medical prices. By mid-2024, general economic inflation has cooled, and medical inflation has picked up and now exceeds the growth of non-medical prices. This delayed effect is expected: As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.",
            "“…it is necessary that we adjust our 2025 premium rates for a number of reasons, including increased medical costs, increased utilization of higher-cost specialty drugs, and inflationary factors that are leading to increasedpayments to hospitals.”– Independent Health Benefits Corporation (NY)",
            "“The unit cost inflation is higher than it has been historically and is driven by hospital systems and health care providers demanding higher contracted reimbursement rates.”– Lifewise Health Plan of Washington (WA)",
            "Looking ahead to 2025, some insurers say general economic inflation has put pressure on their own staffing costs as well. So, in addition to medical prices increasing, insurer overhead costs are, too.",
            "“In light of continued inflationary pressures, Blue Cross VT believes that an overall administrative expenses annual trend of 4.0 percent reflects the expected growth in costs.”– Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (VT)",
            "“Costs are expected to increase due to inflation and cost-of-living adjustments to employee compensation.”– Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington (WA)",
            "In addition to the pressure from general economic inflation, hospital market consolidation and workforce shortages are also having an inflationary impact on health insurance premiums in 2025.",
            "“Many of these [hospital] systems are asking for large increases for services (some requesting double digit annual increases) and have shown a willingness to allow our contracts to expire. Because of the limited competition and regional monopolies some health care providers have achieved, there is reduced market pressure for these systems to innovate new, more efficient practices.”– Premera Blue Cross (WA)",
            "“Despite these efforts, CDPHP and its competitors continue to face financial headwinds, due largely to… rising hospital consolidation and staffing shortages…”– Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oregon (WA)",
            "“Like other payers, Moda is experiencing pressures on multiple fronts related to health care worker labor shortages. With providers experiencing post-pandemic inflationary pressures, they are seeking increases that generally exceed previous years’ requests.”– Moda Health Plan, Inc. (OR)",
            "“Local hospital systems have been challenged financially due to both economic inflationary pressures as well as staffing shortages. Excellus Health Plan has responded to these provider challenges through additional contractual cost increases for our provider systems, resulting in more spending for hospital services.”– Excellus Health Plan, Inc. (NY)",
            "The growing demand for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are used for diabetes treatment and weight loss, is having an upward effect on prescription drug spending. ACA Marketplace insurers employ a variety of strategies like prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits tomanage utilizationof Ozempic and other GLP-1s that are approved for diabetes but have potential for off-label use to lose weight. Relatively few ACA Marketplace insurers cover Wegovy and other drugs that are approved only for weight loss. Nonetheless, several insurers specifically call out GLP-1s as contributing to premium increases in 2025. Below are some examples:",
            "“The pharmacy trend, especially cost, is heavily influenced by the impact of GLP-1 drugs and their use in diabetics treatment as well as the expectation for continued use with the approval for expanded indications.”– Priority Health (MI)",
            "“For the 2025 filing, the [Average Rx New Treatment] factor reflects the anticipated notable impact of new generic and high-cost drugs in 2024-2025, as well as consideration for the significant increase in utilization of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs that we began to see in 2023.”– Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island (RI)",
            "“In this projection period, there are several factors driving high pharmacy trends, specifically: 2023 and early 2024 emerging experience, Increased manufacturer brand and specialty pricing, Increased use of GLP-1s for diabetic therapy, and autoimmune drugs”– Blue Care Network of Michigan (MI)",
            "“The higher cost trend filed reflects the expected change in mix from the older and less expensive GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Trulicity, to the higher cost drugs (Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound) introduced in 2022 and 2023. We expect the percentage of days supply to continue to shift to the more expensive GLP-1s through 2025 and are reflecting this by applying a cost trend of 14.8 percent, instead of the 7.3 percent cost trend applied to other brand drugs.”– Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont (VT)",
            "In addition to GLP-1 drugs, other specialty drugs and biologics, including new gene therapies, are also becoming more prevalent and more costly, which is driving premiums upward.",
            "“Specialty drug trends are expected to increase as more breakthrough gene and cellular products enter the market.”– Anthem HP, LLC (NY)",
            "“Rising drug prices are having a significant impact on overall medical spending trends… However, the savings trend associated with generics is being eclipsed by another trend around the rising cost and utilization of specialty medications including biologics. Every year more and more highly complex specialty medications are approved by the FDA to treat both rare and sometimes more common diseases. Specialty medications are used by approximately 2 percent of our members, but they account for more than 50 percent of total drug spend. Drug trend is a result of both increased utilization and increased unit cost.”– Excellus Health Plan, Inc. (NY)",
            "“…rapidly rising prescription drug costs, which are being driven by increased demand for weight loss medications and the emergence of cell and gene therapies…”– Capital District Physicians Health Plan (NY)",
            "“This trend amount also includes the impact of the gene therapy adjustment… which reflects an estimate for the projected costs of new gene therapy treatments that will occur in 2025”– Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island",
            "In reviewing the 61 insurer filings in depth, we searched for a number of other potential drivers of premiums. We found that the following factors had little to no impact on premiums for 2025.",
            "In April 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision that had allowed Medicaid enrollees to maintain their coverage through the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2024, at least 23 million people have beendisenrolledfrom Medicaid. So far, severalmillionrecent Medicaid enrollees had transitioned onto ACA Marketplace coverage.",
            "A number of insurers mention the Medicaid continuous enrollment unwinding in their 2025 rate filings, however, most of them either do not quantify the impact it is having on their premiums or say that the impact is zero or near zero. In two of the rate filings we reviewed, insurers said the Medicaid unwinding is having a significant upward effect on their 2025 premiums (about 1-2%) and two insurers said it is having a significant downward effect (about -1%).",
            "Similarly, about half of the insurers rate filings reviewed in detail mentioned some aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic (for example, vaccines, treatment, and tests). However, most insurers say the impact of COVID-19 on their 2025 premiums is zero or near zero, suggesting a steady state relative to the base period (2023).",
            "Recent surprise billlegislationholds patients harmless for the extra costs associated with unexpected out-of-network care. So far, mostpayment determinationshave been in favor of providers (as opposed to insurers), which could have an upward effect on insurer costs. Of the insurer rate filings reviewed in depth, though, only one (MetroPlus Health Plan of New York) mentioned the effect of the No Surprises Act, stating,“Out of network emergency care usage levels were evaluated for the impact of legislation limiting surprise billing; no adjustment is made.”",
            "Both the Trump and Biden Administrations have worked to improve transparency of healthcare prices, which could have an effect on provider and insurer negotiations. However, insurers did not meaningfully reference the impact of price transparency rules on their premiums. Only a handful alluded to the existence of consumer-oriented price transparency tools.",
            "Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 324 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 61 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 61 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, surprise billing, specialty medicine, telehealth, price transparency, market consolidation, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.",

            "The consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U) measures the U.S city average change in prices consumers pay for goods and services. For medical care, CPI measures total price changes, including both the costs consumers pay out-of-pocket and those insurers (public and private payers) pay to providers and pharmacies. While CPI measures total price changes, the index weights spending to match consumers’ out-of-pocket costs, including consumers’ spending at the point of care and on health insurance premiums. For example, physician and hospital services are47%of the medical care index.",
            "BLS usednew expenditure weightsto calculate the CPI starting from January 2023 and will continue to update the weights annually. Previously, BLS updated CPI weights once every two years using two consecutive years of consumer spending data. CPI weights will now be calculated each year using one year of spending data for greater accuracy.",
            "Whilethe annual growth inmedicalpricesis once againoutpacing thegrowth in non-medical prices(3.3% vs. 2.9% in June)on average,somenon-medicalgoods and services saw larger increases.Residential rentsgrew by5.1% and electricity costs grew by 4.4%.Otherhouseholdbudgetitems, such asfood and apparel, haveseensmallerprice increases in the past year than medical care. Gasoline was the fastest-growing essential household expense in 2022, reaching a peak inflation rate of 59.9% in June 2022. More recently, as of June 2023, gasoline prices have declined by -2.5% from the same month last year.",
            "Prices for hospital services (6.9%) as well as for nursing homes (6.0%) rose faster than for prescription drugs and physicians’ services (2.4% and 0.8%, respectively). The medical CPI is generally based on lagged data even more so than other CPI categories. For example, the prescription drug CPI does not immediately reflect the introduction of new, high-priced drugs.",
            "The medical care CPI also includes a price index for health insurance. This index measuresretained earningsof health insurers – it is not a reflection of the premiums they set. The health insurance CPI fell from an annual increase of 28.2% in September 2022 (the all-time high) to a decrease of -4.2% in June 2024. However, the health insurance CPI presents data that is almost one-year lagged, so it is not representative of current price changes. In fact, the health insurance CPI through September 2022 reflectsinsurers’ marginsin 2020, as they paid lower medical claims than in a typical year. Nevertheless, insurers likely saw lowermargins, on average, in 2021 and 2022 than they had been in the first year of the pandemic due to returning utilization.",
            "Regardless, with a 9% weight of the total medical consumer price index, health insurance brought the overall medical CPI up during most of 2022 and is now exerting downward pressure.",
            "While the CPI covers inflation in prices paid directly by consumers, another measure of inflation, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, also tracks changes in prices paid on behalf of consumers. For example, the health care services PCE price index covers payments by employers, private insurers, and government programs to providers in addition to premiums and out-of-pocket expenses paid by consumers. The PCE price index also accounts for shifts in consumer spending patterns in response to price changes. CPI, by contrast, assumes consumers buy a similar bundle of goods and services and does not account for trade-offs consumers may be making in response to price changes.",
            "A third measure of inflation, the producer price index (PPI), represents inflation from the producers’ perspective in both the public and private sector. The PPI for health services includes medical services (provided by physicians or other care providers) paid for by third parties, such as employers or the federal government. Unlike the CPI, the PPI considers changes in industry output costs with a focus on the actual transaction prices.",
            "Since June 2009, the CPI-U for medical care services has risen by 54.5%, while the PPI for health care services has increased by 40.3% and the PCE price index for health care services has increased by 32.8%. Services included in this chart include hospital, physician, and other professional and facility care prices. While drugs and medical equipment are included in previous CPI-U charts in this analysis, this chart measures CPI-U of medical care services specifically and excludes drugs and medical equipment in both PPI and CPI-U measures.",
            "Generally, prices paid by private insurance are higher and rise more quickly than prices paid by public payers. Prices for private insurers are the result of negotiations between health systems and the insurance companies, while public payer prices are set administratively. In 2024, healthcare prices paid for by private insurance and Medicaid are rising faster than those paid for by Medicare. The private insurance health services PPI has risen by 29.4% since June of 2014, compared to 15.7% for Medicare and 25.0% for Medicaid in the same period. The overall health services PPI increased by 25.3% since June 2014.",
            "During the public health emergency, Medicare provider reimbursement for COVID-19 treatment was boosted by 20.0%, which explains part of the reason for the increase in the Medicare PPI in 2020.",

            "The United States spends significantly more on healthcare than comparable countries do, and yet hasworsehealth outcomes. Much of the national conversation has focused on spending on retail prescription drugs and insurer profits and administrative costs as key drivers of health spending in the United States. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, includesseveral provisionsaimed at lowering thecost of these prescription drugs.While it is true that many brand-name retail prescription drugs arepriced higher in the U.S.than in peer countries, health spending data indicates that other spending categories – particularly hospital and physician payments – are primary drivers of the U.S.’s higher health spending.",
            "This brief examines the drivers of health spending and differences between the U.S. and its peers – other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations that are similarly large and wealthy. In 2021, the U.S. spent nearlytwice as much per capitaon health asthese comparable countries did. Most of the additional dollars the U.S. spends on health go to providers for inpatient and outpatient care. The U.S. also spends more on administrative costs, and significantly less on long-term care.",
            "Though spending is higher in the U.S., there is little evidence that this gap is driven by higher utilization or higher quality of care. In addition to having generally worse health outcomes than peer countries, people in the U.S. are less likely tosee a doctor, have along hospital stay, and be able to make aprompt appointmentfor medical care. The U.S. also hasfewer physiciansper capita than other countries, making access to care more difficult in some areas.",
            "",
            "In 2021, the U.S. spent nearly twice as much on health per person as comparable countries ($12,197 compared to $6,514 per person, on average).",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health Spending",
            "The largest category of health spending in both the U.S. and comparable countries is spending on inpatient and outpatient care, which includes payments to hospitals, clinics, and physicians for services and fees such as primary care or specialist visits, surgical care, provider-administered medications, and facility fees (see Methods for more details). Americans spent $7,500 per person on inpatient and outpatient care while comparable countries spent an average of $2,969 per person, a difference of $4,531 per person. Patients in the U.S. haveshorter averagehospital stays andfewer physician visitsper capita, while many hospital procedures have been shown to have higher prices in the U.S.This category also includes prescription drugs administered in inpatient and outpatient settings, which may lead to higher cost in countries, such as the U.S., wherethese drugs have higher prices.",
            "Similarly, many retail prescription drugscost morein the U.S. than the same drugs do in other comparable nations. In 2021, the U.S. spent $1,635 per capita on prescription drugs and other medical goods (including retail pharmaceuticals, over-the counter drugs, as well as durable and non-durable medical equipment) while comparable countries spent $944 per capita on average, a difference of $691 per person.  However, even if per capita prescription drug pricing is lowered and closer to that of comparable countries, that difference would make only a dent in the overall difference in health spending. The prescription drugs and other medical goods category also excludes all drugs and medical goods administered directly by a health care provider (those costs are generally included with inpatient and outpatient spending).",
            "Spending on health administration is similarly much higher in the U.S. than in comparable countries: $925 compared to $245 per person, respectively, a difference of $680 per person. Administrative costs include spending on running governmental health programs and overhead from insurers, but exclude administrative expenditures from healthcare providers. This includes administrativespendingfor private health insurance, governmental health programs (such as Medicaid and Medicare) as well as other third-party payers and programs.",
            "The U.S. also spends more on preventive care than peer nations – $589 compared to $426 per capita, on average, a difference of $163; activities captured in this spending category vary amongst countries, but in the U.S. it generally consists of public health activities, including preventive health programs and education for immunizations, disease detection, emergency preparedness, and more. The growth in preventive care spending between 2019 and 2021 is notable, considering the 2020 emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S., preventive care spending more than doubled between 2019 and 2020, from $343 to $741 per capita, but subsequently declined to $589 in 2021. Comparable countries saw two years of increases in preventive care spending, from $166 to $219 to $426 per capita from 2019 to 2021.",
            "Meanwhile, the only category of spending in which the U.S. spendslessthan most comparable countries on a per person basis is long-term care, but the OECD data on U.S. long-term care spending exclude some of the largest sources of spending and are incomplete.",
            "Spending in the “other” category includes ancillary services, and other types of care and medical goods uncaptured in the other spending categories.",
            "Health costs in the U.S. were $5,683more per person than costs in similarly large and wealthy countries. The difference in spending on inpatient and outpatient careis $4,531per person, accounting foralmost 80%of the difference in spending between the U.S. and comparable countries. The U.S. spent $681more per person on administrative costs compared to comparable countries, which represented12% of the difference in overall spending. Theadditionaldollars the U.S. also spent on medical goods and drugs than comparable countries accounted for12% of the overall difference in spending.",
            "In 2021, inpatient and outpatient care represented approximately 62% of total health spending in the U.S. and 46% of spending in comparable countries, on average. Administrative costs represent about 7.6% of overall health spending in the U.S. compared to 3.8% on average in comparable countries.",
            "Although the U.S. spends more per person on retail drugs, over-the counter drugs, and medical goods, these costs represented a slightly smaller share of total spending as compared to the comparable country average in 2021 (13.4% and 14.5%, respectively).",
            "The chart above displays the change in per capita health spending in each category as a share of the overall increase in spending between 2013 and 2021. For example, increased spending on administration was the cause of 7% of spending growth between 2013 and 2021 in the U.S., but only caused 3% of spending growth in comparable countries.",
            "In 2013, the United States spent $8,522 per capita on health, while comparable countries averaged $4,696 per capita. Between 2013 and 2021, health spending grew at a similar rate in both the U.S. and comparable countries (4.6% and 4.2% annually, respectively). However, since spending in the U.S. was significantly higher to begin with, the eight-year increase in spending in dollars was more than double in the U.S. ($3,675) than it was in peer nations ($1,818). The same is true for the growth in many specific spending categories.",
            "In the U.S., the largest growth in terms of dollar value was for spending on inpatient and outpatient care, which grew by $2,216 per capita between 2013 and 2021 (4.5% growth annually). In the U.S. inpatient and outpatient care contributed to 60.3% of the total growth in health spending over this period. In comparable countries, the largest contributor to the growth in spending is also inpatient and outpatient care (which grew by 3.5% annually), but the dollar increase ($710 per capita) is smaller than in the U.S. and the contribution to total health spending growth was smaller (39% of total spending growth).",
            "Notably, growth in spending on long-term care represented a far smaller share of spending growth in the U.S. versus comparable countries (5.4% vs 19.1%, respectively). Long-term care can be expensive or hard to access in the U.S. for many patients.",
            "This brief analyzed health expenditure and financing data from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 12 countries, including the U.S., in 2021. Data consisted of current expenditures on health expressed as per capita, current prices, current purchasing power parity (PPP), in U.S. dollars. Data in this analysis is rounded. Comparable country data was taken by averaging spending data from countries that have above median GDP and above median GDP per capita (Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). Because they did not have data available for 2021, Australia and Japan were dropped from this analysis.",
            "Current expenditures on health consisted of spending as a function of inpatient curative and rehabilitative care, outpatient curative and rehabilitative care, long-term care, ancillary services, medical goods, preventive care, governance and health system and financing administration, and other health services. In our analysis, “other” consists of other health services, ancillary services, and uncategorized spending, which is the difference between the sum of all categories and the total spending. Inpatient and outpatient care have been combined due to differences in when the same service may be performed inpatient versus outpatient depending on the country. The OECDdefinesoutpatient care as care that “comprises medical and ancillary services delivered to a patient who is not formally admitted to a facility and does not stay overnight.” Long-term care services may be provided by hospitals, nursing homes, doctors’ offices, homes or other places. OECD data for U.S. long-term care spending exclude many of those types of spending, resulting in an underestimate of U.S. spending on long-term care services. Medical goods consist of over-the-counter drugs, retail prescription drugs, and goods used for clinical purposes, such as hearing aids, glasses, prosthetics, and medical technical devices.",

            "A class of drugs calledGLP-1 agonists, which includesOzempic (semaglutide),hasbeen used to treat type 2 diabetes for over a decade. Due to their potential to trigger weight loss, focus on these drugs has shiftedinapplicationtoobesity, with new drug products using these same ingredients gaining FDA approval forsuchtreatment. A recentnationwideestimate of obesityindicatedthat42% of adults aged 20 andover areobese.Demand may continue to increase as moreGLP-1 agonistsare approvedfor other conditions, such aspreventing heart attacks or strokesin adults with cardiovascular disease.",
            "Given thehigh cost of GLP-1 agonistsand rising popular interest in these drugs, these medications will likely have an increasing and substantial impact on health care cost for patients and payers. Currently, most private health plans are not required to cover medications for weight loss, but some do so voluntarily and most cover drugs with the same active ingredients for diabetes treatment. For health plans including these drugs on their prescription drug formularies, utilization management tools, like prior authorization and step therapy, can be used to allow medically indicated access to the drugs while controlling costs by tying coverage of the drugs to specific clinical and treatment criteria. Further restrictions may be established through quantity limits, imposing constraints on the dosage and duration of usage.",
            "This analysis examines publicly available formularies of plans available on the federally facilitated Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace in 2024 to identify how utilization management tools are used for GLP-1 agonists. The ACA Marketplaces represent a small share of people with private health insurance, as most people with private coverage have plans sponsored by their employers. However, information on employer plan formularies is not publicly available. Employer plans may be more likely to cover drugs for weight loss than ACA Marketplace plans given the desire to attract workers, though they may employ similar utilization management strategies.Medicareprohibits coverage of drugs used only for weight loss (though Part D plans are allowed to cover Wegovy when used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke for certain beneficiaries) andMedicaidcoverage of weight loss drugs varies by state.",
            "Coverage in formularies varies widely among GLP-1 agonists. Drugs solely approved to treat obesity have minimal to no coverage on most ACA Marketplace formularies. Wegovy, a semaglutide formulation approved for weight loss, is included in just 1% of Marketplace plan formularies, while Ozempic, which has the same active ingredient but is approved for diabetes treatment and sometimes used off-label for weight loss, is included in 82% of Marketplace plan formularies.",
            "",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Among ACA Marketplace plans with these drugs on formulary, prior authorization is required by most plans. All plans covering the drugs approved for weight loss require prior authorization. Similarly, quantity limits are imposed in most plans among those including these drugs on formulary. For GLP-1 agonists, step therapy is much less commonly used as a utilization management tool, with fewer than 1 in 4 Marketplace plans requiring step therapy for each of the drugs included in this analysis. (Under step therapy, patients are required to take certain steps, such as use of alternative drugs, before payment for a drug is approved.) Almost all (>98%) plans use at least 1 utilization management strategy to guide payment for GLP-1 agonists. For comparison, 70% of ACA Marketplace plans use at least 1 utilization management strategy with Xarelto (covered on 97% of formularies), a similarly priced oral anticoagulant with no generic formulation available. Generic metformin, also used to treat diabetes, is associated with utilization management tools in only 30% of ACA Marketplace plans, almost exclusively in the form of quantity limits.",
            "Arecent KFF pollof all adults (insured and uninsured) showed that insurance covered all of the cost for GLP-1 agonists for 1 out of 4 patients using them according to self-reported responses, but over half (54%) of adults taking these drugs had difficulty paying for them. People with large employer coverage pay an average ofnearly $70per monthin out-of-pocket costs for semaglutide when these drugs are covered by their health plan, though this is a small share of the total cost of the drug.Utilization management tools are intended to balance cost control and access but may still pose barriers for people with a medical necessity to take these drugs.With such high demand for andshort supplyfor GLP-1 agonists, some people have procured them from alternative sources, such as online vendors, medical spas, or compounding pharmacies selling products not evaluated by the FDA, some of which may contain different ingredients.",
            "",
            "Methods",
            "GLP-1 agonists included in the analysis were approved for treatment of obesity (Saxenda, Wegovy, Zepbound) and corresponding formulations that may potentially be used off-label for treatment of obesity (Mounjaro, Ozempic, Rybelsus, Victoza). For comparison, in the table below, we also show those GLP-1 agonists with active ingredients only approved for treatment of diabetes that have less potential for off-label weight loss use (Bydureon BCise, Trulicity). All the included drugs are administered by injection, except for Rybelsus, which is taken as a pill. GLP-1 agonist formulations that include insulin were not included in the analysis. Formularies for plans available in 2024 were extracted from addresses listed in CMS Machine Readable URL File Public on February 28, 2024. Issuers with entirely missing data on prior authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits were excluded from analysis. A utilization management tool was considered in use if it applied to all doses a drug was available. The analysis is not weighted by plan enrollment.",

            "The high medical costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth can lead to significant financial burdens for new mothers. While 4 in 10 births are covered by Medicaid, which has minimal cost-sharing, abouthalfof births are covered by private insurance, which can have significant cost-sharing.",
            "An earlier KFFanalysisof claims data from private health plans found that childbirth is associated with an average of nearly $3,000 inadditionalout-of-pocket spending for new mothers, above that of similarly aged women who did not recently give birth. Roughly one third of multi-person households and half of single-person households would not have theliquid assetsneeded to cover typical out-of-pocket costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth in private health plans.",
            "KFF’s recentsurveyof people experiencing health care debt found that parents generally are significantly more likely than non-parents to report having health care debt from their own or someone else’s medical or dental bills.",
            "The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) asks whether respondents have medical debt they have incurred for their own care. Using this data, this analysis looks at the share of new mothers who have significant medical debt (in excess of $250), compared to other young women who did not recently give birth.",
            "Among women ages 18-35, 14.3% of those who gave birth in the last year and a half have medical debt in excess of $250, compared to 7.6% of women in the same age group who did not have a child recently. This comparison group (7.6%) includes some women who have older children, so there could still be residual debt from an earlier birth.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "Similarly, 11.0% of women ages 18-35 who had a child within the last year and a half have at least $1,000 in medical debt, compared to 4.8% of young women who have not recently had a child.",
            "The debt reported here is only for the mother and does not include any medical debt they may have incurred for the care of their children. Medical care for infants could result in even more out-of-pocket costs and higher rates of medical debt.",
            "The out-of-pocket medical costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth, particularly for new parents with private insurance, come at a time when many families are taking on other new expenses to care for a child. Many new parents also experience income loss if their employer is among the75%that do not offer paid parental leave.",
            "Medical debt is associated with a number of other indicators offinancial vulnerability, including carrying credit card balances, incurring late payment and over-limit credit card fees, and relying on cash advances. People with medical debt are also more likely to miss or delay needed medical care due to costs.",

            "Unemployment in the United States has been at or below 4% since November 2021. The health sector, along with the rest of the economy, saw a sharp drop in revenues and employment at the onset of COVID-19 in the spring of 2020. Health services utilization dropped precipitously as providers cancelled elective care and patients practicing social distancing avoided health facilities. Utilization of health services hasremained somewhat lowerthan expected based on the trend in years before the pandemic, and health sector employment remains below pre-pandemic levels.",
            "This chart collection uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics’Current Employment Statistics(CES) andJob Openings and Labor Turnover Survey(JOLTS) data to analyze how jobs and wages in the healthcare industry have recovered compared to the non-healthcare sectors, and how this recovery is distributed across healthcare providers.",
            "In the past, health sector jobs have been relatively recession-proof. During the Great Recession (from December 2007 through June 2009), for example, health sector employment continued to increase – from 13.1 million in December 2007 to 13.4 million in December 2008, and then 13.7 million in December 2009 – even as most other sectors saw significant declines.",
            "The COVID-19 recession was markedly different – as lockdowns spread across the country, health sector jobs fell sharply along with jobs in other sectors. Even so, health sector employment did not fall quite as steeply as jobs in the rest of the economy. In April of 2020, health employment fell to 14.9 million from 16.2 million in 2019 (by -8.2%), while non-health employment fell by -14.0%. Total health employment in February 2020 was 16.5 million.",
            "After this unprecedented drop at the beginning of the pandemic, jobs in both the health and non-health sectors sharply rebounded. Employment had begun to rise in both sectors by May 2020, though while the pandemic recession is over, recovery is incomplete. The health industry had reported 95% of pre-pandemic job numbers by July of 2020, but non-healthcare jobs did not return to 95% of pre-pandemic levels until almost a year later in June 2021.",
            "As of February 2024, the health sector added 66,700 jobs over the previous month. Jobs in the health sector are 5.7% higher than in February 2020 (the previous peak), compared to 3.4% in all other sectors.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "In 2023, 10.8% of people employed in the United States worked in the healthcare sector. This proportion has grown in past decades, from 7.5% in 1990 to 10.6% in 2010, but has remained fairly stable since. In 2020, amid pandemic-related layoffs in other industries, the proportion of workers employed in healthcare increased even as the number of healthcare workers declined, but the percent of workers in healthcare has returned to pre-pandemic levels as employment recovers in other sectors. Within the health sector, the top sites of employment include hospitals (31%  of health sector employees) and physician offices (17%).",
            "While all health service settings had sharp drops in employment at the beginning of the pandemic, most had seen an upturn in jobs by the summer of 2020 – an upward trajectory that has largely continued to the present. By February 2024, physicians’ offices, outpatient care centers, home health services, and hospitals employed more people than they had in February 2020. However, as we show in the charts below, employment in these settings is still below expected levels, given pre-pandemic trends. (Note that Current Employment Statistics data from the most recent two months is preliminary and subject to change).",
            "The number of workers employed at skilled nursing care and elderly care facilities continues to remain below pre-pandemic levels. (Note: Throughout this chart collection, BLS category for continuing care retirement communities and assisted living facilities for the elderly is labeled as elderly care facilities.) Employment in elderly care facilities reached a low of 869,500 in January of 2022 and has been growing slightly since. These facilities had 974,600 employees nationwide in February 2020, and  965,100 in February of 2024—a 1% decrease. Skilled nursing care facilities have seen an 8.3% drop in employment since February of 2020.",
            "Employment in residential mental health and substance use disorder facilities and assisted living facilities for the elderly have rebounded following the pandemic at 8.4% and 4.9% respectively. However, employment in many residential settings remains below pre-pandemic levels. Residential facilities for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities have seen a 3.4% decrease in employment following the pandemic. Since February 2020, continuing care retirement communities have experienced a 6.3% drop in employment.",
            "If health sector employment had continued to grow at pre-pandemic rates, overall health sector employment would be 279,100 higher in February 2024.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Quality of Care",
            "While health employment in many facilities has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels, the effects of the pandemic linger. Employment in most areas had been growing steadily before March 2020, and most jobs have not yet returned to where they likely would have been, based on pre-pandemic job growth rates. As an example, 1.54 million Americans were employed in home health services in January 2020, versus 1.71 million in February 2024. This represents a recovery of all jobs lost at the beginning of the pandemic. However, between 2017 and early 2020, employment in home health had been growing at an average rate of 0.3% per month. If this growth had continued from 2020 through most recent month, home health service employees would number 1.77 million in February 2024, rather than 1.71 million.",
            "Employment had been growing in every health service industry between 2017 and early 2020 except for skilled nursing facilities, where the number of workers had been declining at an average rate of 0.1% per month. Skilled nursing homes employed 1.46 million people in February of 2024, which is 3.9% below the projected 1.52 million had pre-pandemic trends continued.",
            "The Job Opportunity & Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) does not differentiate between healthcare and social assistance positions in monthly data, but it does show that the combined number of health and social assistance job openings has been increasing since April 2020, hitting a record high in March 2022. Even after a decline in April 2022, job openings in healthcare and social assistance are currently more than 50% higher than before the pandemic. Job openings across the labor market also remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, but by less than 30%, indicating that health and social assistance industry employers are working to fill more jobs than other sectors.",
            "At the beginning of the pandemic, the number of workers quitting their jobs declined sharply. In the beginning of 2021, workers began leaving their jobs at higher rates than they had been before the pandemic started. By January 2024, healthcare and social assistance job quits were 2.3% lower than they had been before the pandemic, about the same as quits among all workers in the same period.",
            "The increase in job quitting among healthcare workers has received attention in the media, though job quits rate was high across the economy (the “great resignation”) in the last few years – in fact, quit rates were at the highest levels ever recorded in November 2021. More recently, quits have declined and are now below pre-pandemic levels, indicating that workers are less likely to be voluntarily leaving their jobs. Whether this is due to improved wages and working conditions, increasing economic uncertainty among workers, or some combination of these and other factors remains to be seen.",
            "The unemployment rate during the pandemic among healthcare workers varies by sex, as well as the location of the individual’s usual employment. Hospitaland non-hospital health services workers of both sexeshave seen unemployment rates return toroughly pre-pandemiclevels.",
            "Since February 2020, healthcare jobs have seen average wage increases that mirror those among all employees of private organizations. In the early months of the pandemic, average healthcare wages rose slowly compared to overall workforce wages, as low-wage workers in non-health industries were disproportionately pushed out of the labor force thus driving the average wage higher. However, since mid-2021, health sector wages have increased slightly faster than overall average weekly earnings. Average weekly wages for employees of private organizations increased by 20.6% from $979 in February 2020 to $1,181 in January 2024, while healthcare employee average wages, always slightly higher, have increased 20.8%, from $1,038 before the pandemic to $1,254 in January 2024.",
            "Increases in the average wage do not necessarily translate to higher pay for a given worker, and instead could be driven by changes in the distribution of high or low wage workers. An increase in unemployed low-wage workers would make the average wage higher. Also, these are nominal wages and thus do not account for inflation’s impact on purchasing power.",
            "The upward trend in average health sector wages has been unequally distributed among health settings. Skilled nursing care facility employees have seen the slowest recovery in employment in the aftermath of the pandemic, and they have also seen among the highest average wage increases. Among skilled nursing care employees, average earnings rose by 26.5% between February 2020 and January 2024, from $671 to $849 per week.",
            "Alternatively, offices of physicians which saw the largest rise in employment following the pandemic have seen the lowest average wage increases. Average earnings rose by 12.3% between February 2020 and January 2024, from $1,443 to $1,620 per week. Wages of hospital workers saw a 20.3% increase between February 2020 to January 2024, from $1,269 to $1,527 per week.",
            "Discussion",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapid subsequent changes of both supply and demand in the labor market, will continue to have an impact on employment in the health industry (and the overall economy) for years to come. While hospitals and physicians’ offices have returned to pre-pandemic employment levels, industries such as elderly care and skilled nursing care facilities continue to see relatively low employment. Average wages for health sector positions have increased significantly since the beginning of the pandemic, but this could be at least in part a function of fewerlow-wageworkers employed in those settings.",
            "The United States saw a period of rapid consumer price growth in the first half of 2022. While inflation has not yet seriously impactedprices of healthservices, rising prices of other consumer goods has put upward pressure on wages for all workers, including those in the health sector.",

            "The widespread adoption of electronic health records has improved the ability for patients and providers to send secure electronic messages (emails) to each other through online portals. This trend in patient-provider messaging further accelerated early in the COVID pandemic as more patients sought medical care remotely. The addition of billing codes for digital health services and subsequent changes in insurers’ payment policies have enabled providers to bill insurers and patients for messaging.",
            "The introduction of these newbilling codesin 2020 facilitate physicians and other health providers billing patients and insurers for responding to patient-initiated emails requiring at least 5 minutes of a provider’s time. Providers can bill up to once a week for the total time spent per enrollee for a new medical consultation. Providers cannot bill for emails if they are related to scheduling appointments or prescription refills, sent within 7 days of a visit (in-person or virtual), or are for follow-up after procedures. Insurers can generally decide whether to impose out-of-pocket costs in cases where a provider has chosen to seek reimbursement. Using private health insurance claims data from the Health Care Cost Institute, this brief looks at claims and payments for patient-provider email messaging in 2020 and 2021. Some providers may decide to bill for email messaging, while other providers do not. Because this analysis relies on claims data, only secure emails that have a claim associated with them are included in the analysis. Email messaging that was not associated with a charge—due to provider practice, institutional policies, or ineligibility for billing—are not captured.",
            "The typical cost for an email messaging claim was $39 in 2021, including both the portion paid by insurance and that paid by patients. Although the health plan covered the full cost for most of these claims (82%), those patients with at least some out-of-pocket costs typically paid $25.",
            "The number of email messaging claims among privately insured people spiked in Spring 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and remained elevated in 2021 at about twice the level seen in January 2020. At the height of utilization in April 2020, there was roughly 1 email messaging claim for every 73 office-based evaluation and management visit claims (including in-person and telehealth visits). Subsequently, there was a marked decline, and the number of these claims plateaued for the remainder of 2020 and 2021, averaging about 1 for every 192 office visit claims in 2021. (This includes claims for $0). In terms of cost, the total payment for all email messaging claims was roughly 0.4% of evaluation and management office visit payments in 2021.",
            "Among private health plan email messaging claims with some payment in 2020 and 2021, the median payment (combined for plan and patient) was $39. Enrollee out-of-pocket cost sharing was $0 for 82% of the claims, including claims with no payment by health plan or patient. Fewer than 1 in 5 email messaging claims required enrollee out-of-pocket cost sharing. For those with some cost sharing, the median enrollee out-of-pocket payment amount was $25, with half of the claims cost sharing falling between $14 and $40.",

            "Health Spending",
            "About half (56%) of email messaging claims were provided by physicians and the remainder were from non-physician providers. Of non-physician providers with email messaging claims, most (58%) were physician assistants and nurse practitioners.",
            "Codes for email messaging claims are categorized by the total time spent on the exchange over a 7-day period: 5-10 minutes (short duration), 11-20 minutes (moderate duration), or 21 minutes or more (long duration). Among claims associated with physicians, 43% were short duration (5-10 minutes), 36% were moderate duration, and 20% were long duration codes (21 minutes or more). The vast majority of email messaging claims submitted by non-physician providers used the long duration code (96% of these claims among non-physician providers were for 21 minutes or more).",
            "Among claims for emails with physicians, older patients were more likely to have charges for the long duration: 31% among those ages 55-64 years were for the long duration compared to 20% across all ages.",
            "A large share (37%) of provider-patient email claims included general medical consultation diagnosis codes in 2021. Other common diagnoses in secure email messaging claims related to musculoskeletal pain, counseling, or infections.",
            "Most email messaging claims in private health plans were billed by primary care providers with the specialty of family medicine (32.6%), internal medicine (32.3%), and pediatrics (9.8%). Among family medicine providers with a claim in the HCCI data, 7.9% had a claim for email messaging, the highest across specialties. Dermatology providers also had significant uptake of email messaging: 5.7% had an email messaging claim in the HCCI data.",
            "Direct messaging between healthcare providers and patients through online portals is not new, though providers’ ability to bill insurers for payment has become more common since the COVID-19 pandemic. New billing codes enabled reimbursement for communications between patients and providers. Private and public payersbeganpaying for medical consultations through emails at the beginning of the pandemic, and some evenwaivedpatient cost sharing associated for certain messages and telehealth claims.",
            "Billing for email messaging remained elevated in 2021 (the most recent year of data), though the volume has declined from the peak early in the pandemic when in-person services were suspended. How much billing and payment for patient-provider messages changes in the future remains to be seen. Through 2021, most private health plan email messaging claims did not include patient cost sharing. It’s unclear if private health plans will require patients to share costs for more of these in the future.",
            "Being able to message health providers makes medical advice more easily accessible and convenient for patients. Using email can potentiallyavoidin-person visits (similar to the potential benefits oftelehealth) but management of complex care may be difficult to navigate through email. The payment amounts for patient-provider messages is up for debate: providers argue payments aren’t enough to offset the increasedproviderworkloadassociated with patient emails and payers argue higher payments and increased volume of billing for emails could increase health premiums and overall spending.",
            "Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) physician and outpatient claims data from 2020 and 2021 were used for this analysis. All claims for enrollees under age 65 with employer-sponsored insurance as the primary coverage were included. Claims for patient-provider communication through an online portal were flagged using CPT/HCPCS codes for digital evaluation and management (99421-99423, 98970-98972, and G2061-G2063).If service dates overlapped, claims were aggregated to the first date of service for each enrollee, provider, and CPT/HCPCS code combination.For comparison, outpatient office visit services were identified by CPT codes 99202-99205 and 99211-99215. In characterizing providers, only individual health providers with an NPI entity type 1 were used in the analysis, excluding organization health providers, which accounted for about 5% of the secure messaging claims. Total payments are for 2020 and 2021 combined, and out-of-pocket paid amounts are for 2021.",

            "Despiteover 90%of the United States population having some form of health insurance, medical debt remains a persistent problem. For people and families withlimited assets, even a relatively small unexpected medical expense can be unaffordable. For people with significant medical needs, medical debt may build up over time. People living with cancer, for example, havehigher levels of debtthan individuals who have never had cancer.",
            "High deductibles and other forms of cost sharing can contribute to individuals receiving medical bills that they are unable to pay, despite being insured.KFF pollingshows that people with medical debtreportcutting spending on food, clothing, and other household items, spending down their savings to pay for medical bills, borrowing money from friends or family members, or taking onadditional debts.(The KFF polling found that 41% of adults have health care debt according to a broader definition, which includes health care debt on credit cards or owed to family members.)",
            "This brief analyzes data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to understand how many people have medical debt and how much they owe. A recent Census Bureauanalysison medical debt at the household level found 15% of households owed medical debt in 2021. In this analysis, SIPP data is summarized at the individual level for adults who reported owing over $250 in unpaid medical bills as of December 2021. This analysis focuses on people with over $250 in medical debt, a threshold defined as “significant” medical debt to distinguish from people who owe relatively small amounts.",
            "This analysis shows that 20 million people (nearly 1 in 12 adults) owe medical debt. The SIPP survey suggests people in the United States owe at least $220 billion in medical debt. Approximately 14 million people (6% of adults) in the U.S. owe over $1,000 in medical debt and about 3 million people (1% of adults) owe medical debt of more than $10,000. While medical debt occurs across demographic groups, people with disabilities or in worse health, lower-income people, and uninsured people are more likely to have medical debt.",
            "People with complex heath needs that require ongoing care can see medical bills pile up over time. Those in worse health or those living with disabilities may also experience unemployment or income losses, further contributing to their difficulty affording medical bills. Adults living with a disability are more likely than those without a disability to report owing medical debt (13% vs. 6%). Similarly, adults who report their health status is “fair” or “poor” are more likely to say they owe medical debt than those who say they are in “good” or better health.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "People typically use more health care and often havehigher health care expensesandout-of-pocket costsas they age. Unsurprisingly, the share of adults with medical debt increases with age and middle-aged adults are more likely than young adults to have medical debt. However, the share of adults with medical debt decreases when people reach Medicare age. This analysis shows that 10% of adults ages 50 to 64 report having medical debt, compared to 6% of those ages 65 to 79.",
            "Black Americans are far more likely than people of other racial and ethnic groups to report having medical debt. This analysis shows that 13% of Black Americans report having medical debt, compared to 8% of White and 3% of Asian Americans.",
            "Women are also more likely to report having medical debt (9%) than men (7%), on average. Some of this difference is likely related tochildbirth expensesand lower average income among women than men.",
            "Adults with lower and modest incomes are more likely to have medical debt. This analysis shows that about 1 in 10 adults with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL) report having medical debt. In 2021, the federal poverty line was $12,880 for a person living on their own and $26,500 for a family of four.",
            "Most people in the United States are insured, but adults who were uninsured for part of the year are more likely to report having medical debt (14%) than those who were insured the full year (8%) or uninsured for the whole year (11%).",
            "The burden of medical debt is notdistributed equallyacross the country. Adults living in rural areas and in the South are more likely to report having medical debt.",
            "The chart above highlights the interaction between income and health status.Poor health status is associated with higher rates of medical debt even among people with higher incomes — adults with higher incomes in poor health are more likely to have medical debt than adults with lower incomes in good health.Adults in worse health are more likely to report medical debt when they are also lower- or middle-income. For example, 22% of adults in poor health with household incomes under 400% of the poverty line had medical debt, compared to 14% of adults in poor health with incomes at 400% or more of the poverty line.",
            "Most of the 20 million adults with medical debt owe over $1,000, and about half (11 million people) owe over $2,000. Among the 20 million adults with medical debt, about 3 million (13%) have debt obligations between $5,001 and $10,000, and another 3 million (14%) owe more than $10,000.",
            "Approximately 6% of adults (14 million people) in the U.S. owe more than $1,000, 2% (6 million people) owe more than $5,000 in medical debt, and 1% of adults (3 million people) in the U.S. owe more than $10,000 in medical debt.",
            "The total amount of medical debt is difficult to estimate. While surveys capture a larger share of people and more types of medical debt than analyses of credit reports, there are challenges in capturing data from people who owe high levels of debt. A small share of adults accounts for a large share of the total; for example, 0.3% of adults account for well more than half of the total medical debt. In SIPP, the aggregate amount of medical debt owed among the highest debt holders varies considerably from year to year. To reduce the influence of the highest debt holders on the aggregate amount of medical debt, KFF used a conservative method to calculate the total medical debt for respondents with extremely high debt amounts in SIPP. This approach essentially removes the highest debt values from the calculation.See Methods below for details.",
            "Using this approach, the SIPP survey suggests that total medical debt owed was at least $220 billion at the end of 2021.This total represents the aggregate medical debt for people with over $250 and top coded up to $225,000 in medical debt.This is considerably less than the total medical debt reported in SIPP, but still much more than the total amounts estimated by others using credit reports.",
            "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) estimates that $88 billion in medical debt is reflected on Americans’credit reports, though they acknowledge that the total amount of medical debt is likely higher because not all medical debt is visible to consumer reporting companies and those data only reflect debt among people with credit reports (not all adults). Medical debt can also be masked as other forms of debt, for example, when people pay for a medical expense on a credit card or fall behind on other payments to keep up with medical bills. On one hand, assessing total medical debt through surveys is difficult because a large share of total debt is held by a small share of people. On the other hand, surveys like SIPP may include medical debt that is not visible on credit reports or is otherwise disguised as another form of debt. This analysis suggests that the total amount of medical debt is likely much larger than the already large amount of medical debt reflected on credit reports.",
            "To bolster the number of respondents when analyzing medical debt at the state level, the chart above presents an average of the three most recent years of SIPP data. Annually on average, 8.6% of adults reported having medical debt between 2019 and 2021.",
            "The burden of medical debt varies considerably from state to state. Hawaii (2.3%) and D.C. (2.7%) have the lowest share of adults with medical debt. States with the highest share of adults with medical debt include South Dakota (17.7%), Mississippi (15.2%), North Carolina (13.4%), West Virginia (13.3%), and Georgia (12.7%).",
            "Medical debt remains a persistent problem even among people with insurance coverage. Most Americans have private health insurance, which generally requires payment of a deductible, coinsurance, and copays for medical services and prescriptions. A serious injury or illness can cost thousands of dollars out-of-pocket to meet these deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements. For people with a chronic illness, even smaller copays and other cost-sharing expenses can accumulate to unaffordable amounts. Insured patients can also incur medical debt from care that is not covered by insurance, including for denied claims, and forout-of-network care.",
            "Many Americans, even those with private health insurance, do not have enough liquid assets to meet deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums. Among single-person privately-insured households in 2019, 32% did not have over$2,000saved. Among multi-person households where at least one household member has private insurance, 20% did not have savings over $2,000. Additionally, 16% of privately-insured adults say they would need to take on credit card debt to meet an unexpected $400 expense, while 7% wouldborrow moneyfrom friends or family. For these people, even a medical bill for a few hundred dollars can present major problems.AKFF pollsuggeststhat people with unaffordable medical bills are more likely todelay or skip needed careto avoid incurring more medical debt, cut back on other basic household expenses, take money out of retirement or college savings, or increase credit card debt. People with medical debt are also more likely to haveother forms of financial distress.",
            "Medical debt can happen to almost anyone in the United States, but this debt is most pronounced among people who are already struggling with poor health, financial insecurity, or both. People who are very ill or living with a disability are also at risk of losing their employment or income due to illness. Shortcomings in both health insurance coverage and social safety net programs aimed at replacing income during a time of illness can compound to increase the likelihood that people with serious health care needs end up with large amounts of medical debt. There are also significant racial disparities, with Black Americans being much more likely than people of other racial or ethnic backgrounds to report owing medical debt.",
            "The fact that medical debt is a struggle even among households with health insurance and middle incomes indicates that simply expanding coverage will not erase the financial burden caused by high cost-sharing amounts and high prices for medical services and prescription drugs.",
            "TheSurvey of Income and Program Participation(SIPP) is a nationally representative survey of U.S. households. SIPP asked people aged 15 and older in the household whether they owe any money for medical bills not paid in full as of December 2021. Respondents were asked to exclude bills that will likely be paid by the insurance company. Households may include non-related persons cohabiting together. Respondents younger than age 15 were not asked about medical debt. A Census Bureauanalysisof 2022 SIPP at the household level found 15% of households owed medical debt in 2021.",
            "In this analysis, SIPP data is summarized at the individual level for adults ages 18 years and older. To identify people carrying more than small levels of debt, those reporting medical debt of $250 or less were excluded as some people have very small amounts of medical debt in SIPP.In SIPP, about 1.9 million people reported owing $250 or less in medical debt. Those owing small medical debts of $250 or less represented less than 0.2% of the total medical debt held. SIPP includes estimated debt amounts for people who reported high amounts of debt and these amounts can vary greatly from year to year. The total medical debt held was calculated among people owing over $250 in medical debt and capped up to $225,000 to avoid the influence of extremely high amounts in SIPP.",
            "People with a disability are those who have difficulty with one or more of the six daily tasks (difficulty with hearing, seeing, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, or independent living).The state-level analysis pools the three most recent years of SIPP data for sufficient sample size. The share of adults having medical debt in each state is a pooled average based on SIPP data from 2019 through 2021.SeeSIPPtechnical documentation for additional details.",

            "Medical debt can be a significant financial burden on people and families. Having medical debt can exhaust savings, force families to delay or forgo basic necessities, and divert resources from other important family needs such as housing, education, and retirement.KFF pollinghas found people in families with medical debt are also much more likely to delay or forgo medical or dental care than people without medical debt.",
            "Medical debt is just one component of a person’s overall financial situation. The National Financial Capabilities Survey (NFCS) is a triennial survey sponsored by the FINRA Foundation that provides information on the financial security, experiences, and vulnerabilities of people and households.",
            "People with medical debt are much more likely to have other forms of financial distress than those without medical debt. Key findings include:",
            "Medical debt is common in the United States. In the2021 NFCSused in this analysis, 23% of U.S. adults had medical debt, meaning they had one or more unpaid bills from a medical service provider that were past due at the time of the survey. This is similar to the result from theKFF Health Care Debt Survey, which found that 24% of adults had one or more medical or dental bills that were past due or that they were unable to pay. (The KFF survey also found that 41% of adults have health care debt according to a broader definition, which includes health care debt on credit cards or owed to family members.) For more discussion of the similarities and differences across various surveys on medical debt, see the Appendix.",
            "Adults with medical debt are more likely than those without medical debt to show signs of financial vulnerability across a range of financial measures. Adults with medical debt are more likely to be in a household that spends more than its income, find it very difficult to pay their bills, have no “rainy day” fund, or have had a big drop in income in the past year. Adults with medical debt also are more likely to view their credit report as bad or very bad, to say that “just getting by” describes them well or very well, to rarely or never have any money left at the end of the month, or to say that they often or always feel that their finances control their lives.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Although adults without health insurance are more likely to have medical debt, the financial vulnerability shown across these measures persists even when the population of respondents is limited to adults with insurance. A large majority of the population hashealth insurance, and more than one-in-five adults with health insurance have medical debt. Although medical debt is more concentrated among certain groups – people with low incomes, the uninsured, people unable to work due to their health – it affects people and households across the financial spectrum.",
            "Adults with medical debt are less likely than those without medical debt to have some form of savings account and are more likely to overdraw their checking account or to make late payments on their student loans. They also are more likely, measured for some months over the previous 12 months, to have a credit card balance that exposes them to interest payments, to be charged a late fee or an over-the-limit fee on their credit card, or to take a cash advance on their credit card. More than one half (55%) have been contacted by debt collectors, compared to 8% of adults with no medical debt.",
            "Adults with medical debt are much more likely than adults without medical debt to seek a payday loan, use a pawn shop, use a rent-to-own store, or seek a loan against the title of car. They also are more likely to take a loan or an emergency withdrawal from a retirement account. These types of transactions often come with relatively high interest rates or penalties and can add additional financial stress to already vulnerable households.",
            "Compared to adults with no medical debt, those with medical debt are much more likely to forgo needed medical care; skip a test, treatment, or follow-up care; or not fill a prescription due to cost. These differences persist both among people with insurance and among people without insurance. The overall finding is consistent with theKFF Medical Debt Survey, which showed that large shares of people with medical debt delayed or did not seek out needed medical care.",
            "Young, lower-income individuals with medical debt are more likely to report delaying or skipping care. To evaluate how medical debt impacts medical access, we estimated the increased odds that a person skips or delays care when they have medical debt, controlling for age and income level (See Appendix). For example, an adult between the ages of 18 and 24 who reports having medical debt and makes less than $50,000 a year has a 75% chance of experiencing medical affordability problems such as skipping a medical test or treatment, delaying care, or not filling a prescription due to cost. An adult between the ages of 25 and 54 and an adult 55 or older within the same lower income bracket and with medical debt have a 67% chance and 47% chance respectively of reporting these same affordability issues.",
            "The prevalence and consequences of medical debt have gained more public attention in recent years. Large shares of households with medical debt are financially vulnerable, identifying with phrases such as “just getting by” or “finances control my life.” These results persist when the population is limited to those with insurance, demonstrating that the problem of medical debt is not just, or even primarily, a problem for the uninsured.",
            "Medical debt can stem from various factors, including unaffordable cost-sharing obligations, visits to out-of-network healthcare providers, or the necessity for services not covered by their insurance plan. Medical debt is often just one component of an individual’s overall financial situation, and it frequently compounds other forms of financial instability they may be experiencing. This heightened financial instability can result in individuals forgoing necessary medical care due to concerns about the affordability of services.",
            "Questions about medical debt and other financial matters can be difficult to compare across surveys. For example, it is not always clear whether respondents are answering about their personal experiences or about their broader family or household. Surveys typically ask about different reference periods, or the amount of time which they want respondents to consider.",
            "TheNFCSsurvey used in this analysis obtains information from over 27,000 adults, which can be used to assess the security and vulnerabilities of household finances, as well as the confidence or insecurity of U.S. adults.  The 2021 NFCS was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and so reflects some of the financial concerns that accompanied it. On broad financial measures, however, such as the share of people finding it not at all difficult to pay their bills, the share satisfied with their personal financial situation, the share of people in households spending less than their incomes, the 2021 NFCS showed the same or higher levels when compared to the previousNFCS surveys. This stability offers some confidence that the 2021 NFCS findings provide useful information about the financial circumstances of people with medical debt, outside the financial turmoil during the pandemic. In fact, the share of adults with past due medical bills in the 2021 NFCS is very similar to the share in the 2018 NFCS (23% v. 24%). Another source of information on medical debt, the Survey of Income and Program Participation, shows that8% of adults, or 15% of households have medical debt.",
            "TheKFF Health Care Debt Surveyasked respondents to think about money that they currently owe for their own health care or someone else’s, such as a family member or dependent. In contrast, the U.S. Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) asks whether money was owed for a medical bill and not paid in full during the past year for each person over the age of 14 in the sample household. SIPP results, therefore, can be looked at on the individual level or for an overall household. Additionally, the NFCS asked respondents about unpaid bills from a health care or medical service provider (e.g., a hospital, a doctor’s office, or a testing lab) that are past due. The NFCS and SIPP did not specifically mention dental bills in their medical debt question, while the KFF Health Care Debt Survey did. Without prompting, some households may not include past due dental bills in their reported medical debt. A further complexity is what respondents classify as debt; some surveys such as the KFF Health Care Debt Survey, prime respondents to think about a wide variety of financial vehicles, including bills from providers, outstanding credit card balances and borrowing from a friend or relative.",
            "Medical debt is more common for some types of people: women were more likely to report medical debt than men; younger adults (ages 18 to 24) and older adults (55 and older) were less likely to report medical debt than adults aged 25 to 54; adults without health insurance were more likely to report medical debt than adults with insurance, and adults in the South or the Midwest were more likely to report medical debt than those in other regions. Not surprisingly, the incidence of medical debt falls as household income rises. Adults who are sick, disabled, or unable to work have the highest incidence of medical debt, while retirees often have the lowest.",
            "An important caveat when viewing demographic characteristics about medical debt in the NFCS and similar surveys is that they often represent the characteristics of the person being surveyed, and that person is not necessarily the person whose medical care led to the debt being reported. An adult may bereportingdebt for care of a child and more than one household member may contribute to the total debt being reported.",
            "The 2021 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) consists of a sample of 27,118 adults (above 18 years of age), with approximately 500 respondents in each state and the District of Columbia. California and Oregon were oversampled with 1,250 respondents per state. Respondents were selected using non-probability quota sampling from online panels of millions of individuals provided by Dynata and EMI Online Research Solutions. The survey was distributed through a website format and was self-administered by respondents. The national figures utilized in this analysis were weighted to be representative of the national population based on age, gender, ethnicity, education, and Census division. For more information about survey methods, consult NFCS methodologydocumentation.",
            "Four logistic regression models were implemented, with each having a different response variable representing some aspect of skipping or delaying medical care. These models used age, income, and the presence of medical debt as predictors. The odds ratios for medical debt were calculated by taking the exponential of the log-odds coefficients generated by the models. Then, 1 is subtracted from these values in order to interpret the odds relative to someone without medical debt. Assuming age and income are fixed, someone with medical debt has 485% higher odds of not filling a prescription for medicine due to cost compared to someone without medical debt. Someone with medical debt has 501% higher odds of skipping a medical test, treatment, or follow-up recommended by a doctor due to cost compared to someone without medical debt. Someone with medical debt has 471% higher odds of having a medical problem but not going to a doctor or clinic due to cost compared to someone without medical debt. Someone with medical debt has 492% higher odds of having at least one of these medical access problems compared to someone without medical debt. These models were also used to predict the probability, or chance, of lower-income individuals with medical debt experiencing any of these medical access or affordability problems.",

            "While issues of health care costs and affordability may not be at the forefront of this year’s election, they remain a majorconcernamong the public. Health spending in the United States isprojected to growby 5% between 2023 and 2024, to a total of $4.9 trillion. Here are key health costs and affordability policy issues and trends to watch in 2024.",
            "Payments for outpatient services frequently vary depending on the type of setting where they’re provided. For example, reimbursement rates are often higher for a given service when provided in a hospital outpatient department versus a freestanding physician office, even though in many of these circumstances care may be safe and appropriate in either setting. Policymakers and payers have expressed interest in aligning payments across care settings through “site-neutral payment reforms.” Through legislation and rulemaking, Medicare has aligned payments for office visits across freestanding physician offices and off-campus hospital outpatient departments—which often resemble physician offices—as well as for other services for relatively new off-campus facilities. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in December 2023 (HR 5378) that would align Medicare payments for drugs administered in off-campus hospital outpatient departments and freestanding physician offices, which theCBOestimates would save $3.7 billion over 10 years. Other proposals, such as aligning payments for both on- and off-campus hospital outpatient departments with payments for ambulatory surgical centers or physician offices for certain services, could lead tomuch larger savings. Policymakers have alsoexploredreformsintended to address outpatient facility fees—which are on top of professional fees for a given service andcan add substantiallyto the total bill—charged by hospitals and other institutional providers in commercial markets. In addition to directly lowering costs for payers and individuals, site-neutral payment reform could reduce the incentive for hospitals to buy up physician practices, a practice which has been associated with higher commercial prices. Nonetheless, hospitals and other opponents have argued that there are differences in the patients that hospitals care for, the services they provide, and their cost structure that justify higher payment rates.",
            "Federalprice transparencyrequirements exist to allow consumers to compare prices across hospitals and providers. Health plans and employers may also be able to use some of the price transparency data to negotiate lower rates. There is bipartisan interest in price transparency and recently the U.S. House passed a bill (HR 5378) codifying existing price transparency regulations and extending the requirements to diagnostic labs, imaging services, and surgical centers. However, theCongressional Budget Officeexpects price transparency to have very little impact on health sector prices. State-levelstudiessuggest price transparency can result in unintended consequences if it results in competitors demanding higher prices. Additionally,fewconsumers use these tools to shop for care, and those who do try to price-shop may find that timely or convenient alternatives are not available. For price transparency to make a meaningful difference in costs for consumers, targeted approaches with a more limited set of services that consumers truly shop for may be most effective. Price transparency is a largely bipartisan issue, so federal solutions to these issues are not impossible in 2024.",
            "TheInflation Reduction Act of 2022included numerous provisions aimed atprescription drugspending in the Medicare program, including capping insulin cost-sharing to $35 a month (starting 2023), requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates if prices exceed inflation (starting 2023),capping Medicare Part D out-of-pocket drug spendingby eliminating the 5% coinsurance requirement for catastrophic coverage (in 2024) and adding a hard cap at $2,000 (starting in 2025) , and requiring the federal government to negotiate prices for some high-spend drugs (negotiated prices take effect in 2026). Before the Inflation Reduction Act, CMS projected aggregate out-of-pocket retail prescription drug spending to increase steadily throughout the 2020s. CMS now expects out-of-pocket drug spending to peak in 2023 at $52.5 billion and decline thereafter through 2027 as provisions take effect. By 2030, total out-of-pocket spending onretail prescription drugsis projected to be $48.1 billion, 18.5% lower than the $59.0 billion projected previously. While none of these provisions cover privately insured people, the effects of some of the Medicare drug price regulations may spill over to the private market, though the effects are highly uncertain, including whether manufacturers might attempt to make up for lost revenue in Medicare by raising prices for other payers.",
            "Many proposals have sought to increase transparency in pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) operations, for example, by requiring the disclosure of rebates and discounts negotiated with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Transparency measures are intended to provide more clarity on the pricing dynamics within the pharmaceutical supply chain. Other proposals are aimed at regulating how the PBM market operates; for example, banning PBMs from charging health plans more for a drug than the amount they reimburse pharmacies (a practice known as “spread pricing”), requiring PBMs to pass on all rebates received from manufacturers to health plans, or limiting compensation to PBMs based on a flat-dollar service fee, which would dampen current incentives around rebates based on high drug prices. Additional efforts have focused on market dynamics and competition among PBMs. For example, the Federal Trade Commission recently has deepened itsinquiryinto business practices of PBMs and rebate aggregators. These efforts may shed light on the impact of rebates and discounts on health care costs in the future. The House passedlegislationin December 2023 with several provisions targeting PBMs, but it is unclear which provisions could become law as part of broader health care or spending-related legislation this year.",

            "Obesity, one of the most common health conditions in the U.S., saw new treatments enter the spotlight in 2023 – most notably, the use of semaglutide and tirzepatide drugs forweight loss. While thecoverage of these drugs is still being debated by many health plans and the long-term effects have yet to be determined, they have become an extremely popular option for patients and shown promise in clinical trials. In 2024, more Americans will want access to these medications, and spending on them will continue to increase. Notably, however, Medicare does not cover drugs used for weight loss, so it remains an open question whether people with Medicare will enjoy broad access to these medications as long as this coverage restriction remains in place. At the same time, lifting Medicare’s coverage prohibition would lead tosubstantially higher Medicare spending, given the high price of these medications and expected demand. It remains to be seen if medication for obesity can lead to significant population-level health improvements and potentially reduce spending on care for related diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes. Privateinsurersand employers are figuring out whether and how to cover these new drugs—coverage and cost-sharing will likely vary by health plan. Additionally, new high-costcell and gene therapiesshow potential for improving health outcomes and may also affect total health spending; coverage for new treatments will also likely vary by payers and health plans.",
            "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, health care visits via telehealthincreasedsubstantially. Regulators and payers beganreimbursingfor virtual care, expanding clinician participation and patient access. Medicare removed restrictions on the use of telehealth that were in place prior to the pandemic,broadening accessto telehealth services for beneficiaries in both urban and rural areas, at home and in other settings, using audio-visual and audio-only technologies, and from a wide range of health care providers. Expanded access under Medicare is scheduled to expire at the end of 2024, though there are proposals to make these provisions permanent. Regulators also expanded clinicians’ ability to practice and prescribe over virtual consultations. Particularly when in-person care may not be safe, like during the pandemic, or where there are limits to accessing providers in-person, virtual care provides a convenient alternative. Additionally, new state-level restrictions on access to certain services, such as abortion drugs, have sparked interest in prescribing across state lines, which is currently heavily restricted. Howtelehealthand virtual care affect care coordination, quality of care, health outcomes, and overallcosts, remains to be seen in 2024.",
            "Severalstateshave introduced measures to curb health cost growth. States’ experimentation with health care cost controls could have a snowball effect if other states take up similar measures. Programs such as those inMassachusetts,Rhode Island, andMontanawere piloted in the 2010s and their long-term impact is beginning to take shape. The Biden Administration has made funds available for states planning multi-payer hospital global budgets or cost control strategies through theAHEADmodel. However, there are some limits on the extent to which states can address drivers of health spending. For example, states are the primary regulators of providers, but can only regulate fully-insured private health insurance plans, which cover just one-third ofworkersnationally. While there is not a singular national health care cost control strategy, states’ efforts could influence federal policy makers. In 2024, states with cost containment efforts are likely to put effort into demonstrating their effectiveness, and states without these programs may consider adding them.",
            "Among privately insured patients, about 1 in 5 emergency room visits and between 9% and 16% of in-network hospitalizations for non-emergency care were previously at risk of surprise bills from out-of-network providers. Congress passed a bill at the end of 2021 prohibiting mostsurprise bills. For out-of-network services and items covered under the law, plans and providers are no longer allowed to send patients surprise, out-of-network balance bills. How much out-of-network providers are paid is actively being disputed by provider groups in several legalchallenges. Outcomes of these challenges will affect payments to providers and health insurance premiums.",
            "Theuninsured ratehas decreased to a historic low as a result of continuous Medicaid enrollment during the COVID pandemic and expanded subsidies through the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces during the Biden Administration. However,affordabilityissues persist among people with health insurance. Many people don’t have enoughsavingsto pay for typical deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. Additionally, millions of Medicaid enrollees have beendisenrolled, which is likely to increase the uninsured rate. With higher uninsurance rates, health care affordability issues may increase. Medical debt also remains a significant issue in the U.S., including among people with health insurance. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is planning to require credit reporting agencies to removemedical debtfrom credit reports, as well as cracking down on collection practices that either skip informing patients of outstanding medical bills or put undue pressure on consumers for payments. These measures will free up credit for living expenses. However, unexpected and large health care bills will still occur, particularly for people with significant health care needs and lower income. Some states have similarly acted to remove medical debt from consumers’ credit reports. States and local municipalities have also taken action to buy their residents’ medical debt, in part with remaining COVID relief funds. While these efforts help some consumers, they don’t change the root cause of medical debt – high health care costs and underinsurance.",
            "For over a decade, there has been significanteffort to shiftfrom fee-for-service payment models to value-based payment or pay-for-performance models. The intention is to shift some of the cost risk from payers to providers, and engage providers in improving quality while lowering costs. These payment models vary in structure. Some pay for a bundle of services or on a capitated per enrollee basis, adjusted for case-mix. Others adjust a portion of payments based on various quality and patient care measures. At least a third of providerpaymentsacross Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial payers are now based on quality- or value-based models. While some of Medicare’s value-based payment models have demonstrated cost savings, amajorityhave resulted in increased costs with little to no change in quality. Some quality-based payment models (for example, Medicare’s value-based payment program for clinicians)have been criticizedfor increasing administrative burden and costs on providers, which mayreduce physicians’ incentivesto participate. According to CBO, the activities of Medicare’s innovation center (CMMI) increased federal spending by$5.4 billionfrom 2011 to 2020, which CBO attributes in part to the mixed success of many models at generating sufficient savings to offset their high upfront costs. According to CBO, the voluntary nature of most CMMI models means that providers may self-select into models where they expect gains or not participate where they expect losses. CMS is looking at whether to requireparticipationin more models. Even in the absence of savings, areviewof select CMMI models provides evidence of improvements in care coordination, team-based care, and other care delivery changes.  CBO’s report and generally disappointing cost savings so far could shifthow policymakers and payers move forwardwith value-based payment models in the future.",
            "Consolidation in the health care sector can result in higher costs. For example, a substantial body ofevidence showsthat consolidation in provider markets has led to higher prices without clear evidence of improvements in quality. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice, and state antitrust agencieseach play a rolein challenging consolidation and other anticompetitive practices in health care markets. The federal agencies have signaled their interest in expanding their scrutiny of different types of mergers and acquisitions, including cross-market mergers, private equity acquisitions, and vertical consolidation. The extent to which antitrust agencies play an active role and are successful in challenging anticompetitive practices will likely have an effect on health care costs. Some have proposed strengthening antitrust regulation as a tool for tackling rising health care costs, increasing the affordability of care, and reducing the large number of adults with medical debt. Nonetheless, there are challenges to an approach that relies solely on efforts to foster competitive provider markets through antitrust regulation, for example, given the already high level of market concentration of health care providers across the country.",

            "In this chart collection, we examine how U.S. health spending compares to health spending in other OECD countries that are similarly large and wealthy, based on median GDP and median GDP per capita. For this analysis, we reviewed the OECD Health Statistics database.",
            "Wealthy countries, including the U.S., tend to spend more per person on healthcare than lower-income countries. However, even among higher-income countries, the U.S. spends far more per person on health.",
            "Comparing health spending in the U.S. to other countries is complicated, as each country has unique political, economic, and social attributes that contribute to its spending. Because health spending is closely associated with a country’s wealth, the remaining charts compare the U.S. to similar OECD countries—those with both above median national incomes and above median income per person (as measured by GDP and median GDP per capita) in at least one of the last ten years.",
            "Health expenditures per person in the U.S. were $12,555in 2022, which was over $4,000 more than any other high-income nation. The average amount spent on health per person in comparable countries ($6,651) isabouthalf of what the U.S. spends per person.",
            "In almost all peer nations, health spending per capita increased between 2021 and 2022, with the exception of the Netherlands where spending declined by 0.1%. In the U.S., per capita health spending saw a 2.9% increase, a smaller increase than in most comparable nations, though larger than in Australia (2.4%), Canada (0.7%), and the United Kingdom (0.5%). Belgium had the largest increase in per capita health spending among countries with available data between 2021 and 2022, at 9.6%.",
            "This 2.9% increase in per capita health spending is slightly higher than the previous increase between 2020 and 2021 (2.4%), but still much lower than the 9.8% increase from 2019 to 2020.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "Over the past five decades, the difference between health spending as a share of the economy in the U.S. and comparable OECD countries has widened. In 1970, the U.S. spent about 6.2% of its GDP on health, similar to spending in several comparable countries (the average of comparably wealthy countries was about 4.9% of GDP in 1970). The U.S. was relatively on pace with other countries until the 1980s, when health spending in the U.S. grew at a significantly faster rate relative to its GDP.  Since then, health spending as a share of the economy has grown faster in the U.S. than in peer nations.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic led to both an increase in health spending and an economic downturn resulting in higher health spending as a share of the GDP in the U.S. and every comparable country between 2019 to 2020. As the economy has recovered since then, health spending as a share of GDP has declined in the U.S. and most other peer nations. In 2020, the U.S. spent 18.8% of its GDP on health-related expenditures, up from 16.7% in 2019). Health spending as a share of GDP in the U.S. declined to 17.4% in 2021 and then 16.6% in 2022—but remains substantially higher than in peer countries.",
            "While the U.S. has long had higher than average health spending, recent years have seen higher spending growth in other nations. Historically, the 1980s saw accelerated growth in health expenditures per capita in the U.S. The 10.0% average annual growth rate in the U.S. during the 1980s was significantly higher than comparable countries. Comparably wealthy countries saw an average of 7.3% annual growth during this period.",
            "Looking at 5-year growth rates, during the period from 2005-2010, the U.S. saw an average annual growth rate in health spending of 4.1%, compared to 7.2% during the previous five-year period. Comparable countries also saw health spending growth slow down on average, from 4.5% average annual growth during the 2005-2010 period, down from 5.3% during the 2000-2005 period.In the 5 years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic (2015-2020), the U.S.’s growth in health spending per capita outpaced the average for comparable countries (5.0% versus 3.6%).The annual growth rate for the average of comparable countries increased between 2020 and 2022 to 7.0% versus a 2.7% increase for the U.S. during the same period.",

            "This chart collection explores trends in how cost affect access to healthcare in the U.S. using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data through 2022.",
            "In the 2022 NHIS, more than 1 in 4 adults (28%) reported delaying or not getting healthcare due to cost. An even larger share of households had at least one family member who faced cost-related care barriers. While most adults are in good health at a given time, they may have a sick, uninsured, or underinsured family member, leading to medical bills putting a strain onhousehold budgets.KFF pollingfrom March 2022 found four in ten adults (43%) report that they or a family member in their household put off or postponed needed healthcare due to cost. Uninsured adults, adults in worse health (reported as fair or poor health status), and Hispanic adults are much more likely than others to delay or forego healthcare due to cost.",
            "As background, most adults (90%) have health insurance, and the majority (85% of adults) also report their health as at least good. However, many adults continue to face barriers to accessing medical care.",
            "While similar shares of adults reported not having a usual source of medical care (11%) or that they or a family member had difficulty paying medical bills (11%), a larger share of adults reported that they delayed or did not get healthcare due to cost (28%) or that they were worried about their ability to pay medical bills if they were to get sick or have an accident (45%).",
            "In 2022, more than 1 in 4 adults (28%) reported delaying or going without either medical care, prescription drugs, mental health care, or dental care due to cost. A smaller share of adults (15%) reported foregoing medical care, prescription drugs, or mental health care due to cost.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "While a similar share of adults reported delaying or going without medical care (8%), prescription drugs (7%), or mental health care (6%) due to cost, a much larger share reported foregoing dental care (21%) due to cost.",
            "Most Americans do not report cost-related access barriers to healthcare. Half of the population haslittle or noout-of-pocket medical spending. Still, a substantial portion of the population—about 1 in every 12 adults (8%)—said that they either delayed or did not receive medical care due to cost in 2022.",
            "The chart above is based on NHIS questions asking about missed or delayed “medical care.” There are subsequent questions that ask about missed or delayed mental health care, dental care, and prescriptions due to cost. While some people answer yes to multiple questions, others say that they only missed or delayed one type of care. As shown in later charts, adding all types of missed or delayed care results in a larger share of adults delaying or foregoing care.",
            "The share of adults reporting that they did not get medical care or did not take medicine as prescribed due to cost declined sharply in 2020 and has remained at about that level since. The decline was at least in part because of peopleforegoing care due to COVID-19.The share of adults going without mental health care because of cost increased through 2022 and increased above pre-pandemic levels by early 2023.",
            "In the second quarter of 2023, a similar share of adults reported not taking medicine as prescribed (7.2%), not getting needed medical care (6.2%), and not getting needed mental health care (5.6%) due to cost. Note that respondents may answer yes or no to any of these questions so they should not be totaled.",
            "Hispanic adults had higher rates of facing cost barriers to accessing care than all other people (39%). Estimates for Asian people were the lowest among all race and ethnic groups for delaying or foregoing health or dental due to cost (21%).",
            "Adults in worse health are twice as likely to report delaying or not getting some form of care due to cost compared to adults in better health (45% versus 25%). Those who are uninsured at any point in the year reported delaying or not getting care due to cost at much higher rates compared to those who are insured (57% versus 25%). These estimates include adults who reported delaying or not getting medical, mental health, and dental care due to cost as well as those who reported delaying, not getting, skipping, or taking fewer doses of prescription drugs due to cost.",
            "Some people miss or delay care they cannot afford, while some people still receive the care and go into medical debt, and some people experience both types of challenges associated with high medical costs.",
            "Among adults, 1 in 9 (11%) stated that they or a family member had difficulty paying medical bills. However, 1 in 5 uninsured adults (20%) said they or a family member had difficulty paying medical bills. Insured adults reported difficulty paying medical bills at a lower rate. Even then, 10% of insured adults reported having difficulty paying medical bills for themselves or a family member. Adults with worse health report they or a family member had difficulty paying medical bills at over twice the rate of adults with better health (22% versus 9%). Black Americans had a higher share of adults in families reporting difficulty paying medical bills compared to all other race and ethnic groups (15%).",
            "About half of adults (45%) report being worried about their ability to pay medical bills if they get sick or have an accident. Out of all race and ethnic groups, Hispanic adults were the most likely to report being worried about being able to pay medical bills in case of an illness or accident (62%), while White adults were the least likely to do so (40%).",
            "Meanwhile, three in four uninsured adults (75%) report being worried about paying medical bills in case of an illness or accident. Even a large share of insured adults (42%) report being worried about medical bills. Adults in worse health are more likely to worry about paying medical bills than adults in better health (56% versus 44%).",
            "Uninsured adults arenearly fivetimesaslikely than insured adults to have no usual source of care (38% versus 8%).While the share of adults without a usual source of care is similar across mostraceand ethnic groups,Hispanic adults (17%) are more likely than others to report not having a usual source of care.",
            "Adults with incomes below 200% federal poverty level (FPL) are more likely to delay or go without medical caredue to costthan those with incomes above 200% FPL (13% versus6%). Additionally, among people with employer-sponsored insurance, those with lower incomes spend alarger shareof their incomes on insurance premiums and cost-sharing.",
            "From 2000 to 2009, there was an increase in the share of adults, those who report worse health, and those who were uninsured who reported delaying or going without care due to cost. However, between 2010 (when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law) and 2015 (the year after the expansion of Medicaid and opening of ACA Marketplaces), there was a decline in the share of adults who report delaying or going without care because of cost.",
            "Starting with the 2019 NHIS, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) redesigned the questionnaire and updated the sampling weights methodology. As a result, changes in estimates from 2018 to 2019 cannot be attributed to actual change over time alone. The shaded gray region in the chart above indicates the break in the survey. The trend from 2018 to 2019 in the percent of adults delaying or foregoing care is likely at least partly due to changes to NHIS questionnaire and sampling weights, rather than actual changes in access to care alone.",
            "Uninsured adults and adults in worse health continue to face access barriers due to the cost of care. In 2022, 29% of uninsured adults reported delaying or not getting care due to cost compared to 6% of insured adults.",
            "The share of uninsured adults and adults in worse health reporting foregone care due to cost increased between 2021 and 2022 after a sharp decrease between 2019 and 2021. Part of this might be because COVID-19 presentedanother reasoncare was delayed or foregone during the height of the pandemic. COVID-related stay-at-home measures, potential risk of infection at doctors’ offices and hospitals, and concerns over hospital capacity led to sharp declines inutilization. In 2022—two years after the start of the pandemic—financial barriers to accessing care may be more salient for some people. The decline in theuninsured ratefrom 2019 to 2021 could have also contributed to fewer adults reporting cost-related barriers to accessing care in this period.",
            "In 2021, 1 in 4 adults (26%) reported delaying or going without medical care due to either cost or the COVID-19 pandemic. That year, the share of adults who reported foregoing medical care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but not cost (17%) was larger than the share of adults who reported foregoing medical care due to cost, but not the COVID-19 pandemic (5%). In addition to cost and the pandemic, there could beadditionalreasons fordelaying or foregoing care, such as an inability to take time off from work, a lack of transportation, or a lack of available appointments. The 2022 NHIS did not ask respondents whether they delayed or did not get medical care due to COVID-19.",
            "In 2021, 1 in 6 insulin users (17%) reported either delaying buying insulin, skipping an insulin dose, or taking less insulin than needed due to cost. Among all adults, 7% reported rationing prescribed medication due to cost and 5% did not get needed prescription medication to save money. The 2022 NHIS did not ask respondents whether they rationed insulin due to cost.",
            "In 2022, severalmeasuresto address medication costs for Medicare beneficiaries were signed into law as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. These provisions include a $35 monthly cap on the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Medicare beneficiaries and federal price negotiations for certain medications covered by Medicare.",
            "In 2021, among non-elderly adults (ages 18-64 years) with private insurance, over 1 in 5 of those taking insulin (22%) reported delaying buying, skipping, or taking less insulin to save money. This shareroseto 30% among non-elderly adults without health coverage.The 2022 NHIS did not ask respondents whether they rationed insulin due to cost.Congresscappedout-of-pocket costsfor insulin for people with Medicarestarting in 2023. However,affordability for insulin will continue to be an issue for people withprivate insurance or without health coveragein the future.",
            "According to a2022 KFF Health Care Debt Survey, 41% of adults reported having some amount of healthcare debt. Among adults with healthcare debt, nearly 2 in 3 (64%) either put off or postponed getting care they needed, and half (51%) did not get a medical test or treatment that was recommended by a doctor. Additionally, 15% of adults with healthcare debt were denied care due to their debt.",
            "While most adults in the U.S. have health insurance, cost-sharing can place financial burdens on enrollees,contribute to debt, and render care unaffordable. For example, more than 40% of U.S. householdsdo not have enough assetsto pay a typical private plan deductible. People with lower incomes, people with worse health status, and Black Americans aremore likely to have significant medical debt.",

            "In a given year, a small portion of the population is responsible for a very large percentage of total health spending. We tend to focus on averages when discussing health spending, but individuals’ health status – and thus their need to access and utilize healthcare – varies over the course of their lifetimes. In fact, very few people have spending around the average.",
            "This collection of charts explores trends in health spending variation across the population through an analysis of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data.",
            "In the U.S., most of the population (90%) reported “good” or better health. Only 2% reported being in poor health. As people age, they are more likely to experience health complications and utilize healthcare. Among people age 65 and over, 20% report their overall health as “fair” or “poor” compared to 8% of people under age 65.",
            "While there are people with high spending at all ages, overall, people 55 and over accounted for 55% of total health spending in 2021, despite making up only 31% of the population. In contrast, people under age 35 made up 44% of the population but were responsible for only 21% of health spending.",
            "Health spending often increases with age, as we generally have more health conditions and need more care as we grow older. However, there are some exceptions. For example, average healthcare spending per person for enrollees ages 60-64 in large employer plans ishigherthan average spending for traditional Medicare beneficiaries ages 65-69.",
            "A small portion of the population accounts for a large share of health spending in a year. Although we tend to focus on averages, few people have spending around the average, since individual health needs vary over the life course. Some portion of the population (older adults and those with serious or chronic illnesses) require more and higher-cost healthcare than those who are younger or otherwise typically in need of fewer and less costly healthcare.",
            "In 2021, 5% of the population accounted for nearly half of all health spending. The 5% of people with the highest health spending had an average of $71,067 in health expenditures annually; people with health spending in the top 1% had average spending of $166,980 per year. At the other end of the spectrum, the 50% of the population with lowest total health spending accounted for only 3% of all health spending; the average spending for this group was $385. Roughly 14% of the population had $0 in health expenditures in 2021.",
            "Health spending is concentrated even within populations with relatively high average health costs. Among people reporting fair or poor health, the top 10% of people with the highest health spending accounted for 55% of total health spending.",
            "Considerable spending variation exists between those who are 65 and over and those under the age of 65, with younger persons experiencing more concentrated health spending. In 2021, just over half (53%) of all health expenditures among adults ages 18 through 64 was concentrated in people in the top 5% of total health spending while the same percentage (53%) of all health expenditures among adults 65 or older was concentrated in people in the top 10% of total health spending.",
            "Although health spending for families includes people with higher and lower spending within each family, the distribution of family spending is almost as skewed as for individual spending. In 2021, one percent of all families accounted for 17% of all health spending. Families in the top 5% of health spending accounted for about 39% of all spending.",

            "Access & Affordability",
            "Out-of-pocket spending includes direct payments to providers and cost-sharing but does not include out-of-pocket premium payments or contributions towards health coverage. Out-of-pocket health spending is similarly concentrated among high-health-need individuals. This small portion of the population accounts for a substantial share of total out-of-pocket health spending in a year.",
            "Just one percent of the population accounted for 27% of all out-of-pocket spending for healthcare in 2021. People in the top 5% of out-of-pocket health spending accounted for half (52%) of all out-of-pocket spending in the country. At the other end of the spectrum, the half of the population with the lowest out-of-pocket health spending accounted for just 1% of all out-of-pocket spending.",
            "On average, people in the top 1% of out-of-pocket spending paid $24,487 out-of-pocket for healthcare per year, and people in the top 10% spent $6,185 out-of-pocket per year. Many people have little or no out-of-pocket spending on medical care. People who are in the bottom 50% of out-of-pocket spending spent an average of $24 out-of-pocket in 2021.",
            "When it comes to inpatient spending, the people in the bottom 50% of total health spending had virtually no inpatient expenses, compared to an average of $18,544 annual inpatient spending for people in the top 5%. The patients with the highest health spending also have higher prescription drug spending: individuals in the top 5% had average health spending of $18,140 a year, compared to the overall average of $1,579.",
            "Individuals in the top 5% of health costs make up the majority of total health spending for some types of healthcare. Patients in the top 5% of health spending account for 69% of all home health expenses and 75% of all hospital inpatient expenses. They also account for nearly half of all prescription drug spending.",
            "Average out-of-pocket spending for all types of healthcare is also concentrated among people with higher spending. In 2021, people in the top 5% of out-of-pocket health spending spent an average of about $834 for prescription drugs, while people in the bottom 50% spent $7 on average. This concentration in out-of-pocket spending is true for other types of healthcare as well. People in the top 5% of out-of-pocket spending spent about $388 on inpatient stays, while individuals in the bottom 50% had virtually no inpatient stays or inpatient out-of-pocket spending. People in the top 5% of out-of-pocket spending made up 86% of home health out-of-pocket spending, 59% of inpatient out-of-pocket spending, and 60% of all ambulatory out-of-pocket spending.",

            "Adults with a current or prior diagnosis of certain chronic health condition(s) have much higher spending on average than people without these conditions. Among the listed diseases in the chart above, adults diagnosed with emphysema or cancer on average had the largest difference in health spending compared to those without a diagnosis.",
            "Adults who have been diagnosed with a serious or chronic disease have significantly higher out-of-pocket spending. Among adults, individuals who have been diagnosed with diseases like cancer or arthritis can have out-of-pocket spending twice as high as those who have not been diagnosed.",
            "In addition to the above conditions, compared to people without a mental health diagnosis, privately insured people withdepression and/or anxietyspend almost twice as much out-of-pocket.",
            "Among children, there is not a significant difference in health spending between sexes. Average health spending increases throughout adulthood for both men and women, but at somewhat different rates. Women have higher health spending than men in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s, largely due to pregnancy and delivery-related care. Spending differences between men and women are not statistically significant in older age groups.",
            "Overall, White people in the U.S. have significantly higher average total health spending than people in other race and ethnic groups. People who identified as either Asian or Hispanic had relatively low average health spending in each adult age category. Differences in health spending by race and ethnicity may be driven by a variety of factors, including health status, insurance coverage, age distribution, and access to care.",
            "People of color are younger, on average, than Whitepeople, Hispanic people are more likely to beuninsured, and Hispanic and Black people aremore likelyto report delaying or going without medical care due to costs. Private health plans tend to pay higher prices for healthcare than public plans do. About three in four Asian and White people are enrolled inprivatehealth plans at some point in a given year, while about one in two Black and Hispanic people are covered by private plans at some point in a given year.",
            "Immigrants havelowerhealth spending on average than those born in the United States. Asian and Hispanic people make up thelargest sharesof immigrant populations at about 44% and 27%, respectively.",

            "Employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) is the largest source of health coverage for non-elderly people, covering 60.4% of this population in March 2023. Not all workers have access to ESI, however; some workers are in jobs where the employer does not offer coverage (usually smaller employers) and some workers are not eligible for the coverage offered at their job. Additionally, some workers do not enroll in the ESI they are offered.",
            "This chart collection presents analysis of data from recent Annual Economic and Social (March) Supplements (ASEC) of the Current Population Survey (CPS) to examine who among non-elderly people has ESI and which workers are offered and eligible for coverage at their current jobs.[1]Coverage, work for an employer that offers coverage, and worker eligibility for offered coverage are each measured at the point in time of the survey.[2]A fuller description of the methods is included below.",
            "Key takeaways include:",
            "The workplace has long been a significant source of coverage for those in working families. A previous chartcollection, analyzing a different source of data (see methods), showed a nine percentage-point decline in the share of non-elderly people with ESI between 1998 and 2018. The data from the 2019 to 2023 ASEC show that the share of non-elderly people with ESI was largely stable over the period, despite the economic dislocations arising from the COVID-19 epidemic.[3]",
            "In March 2023, 60.4% of the non-elderly, or about 164.7 million people, had ESI. Of these, 84.2 million had ESI from their own job, 73.8 million were covered as a dependent by a someone within their household, and 6.7 million were covered as a dependent by someone outside of their household.",
            "A relatively small share of these people also held other coverage at that time: 3.2% were also covered by Medicaid or other public coverage and 0.6% were also covered by non-group coverage.",
            "ESI coverage varied dramatically with income. More than four in five (84.2%) non-elderly adults with incomes of 400 of poverty or more had ESI, compared to 59.0% with incomes between 200% and 399% of poverty and 23.9% with incomes below 200% of poverty.",
            "Among non-elderly people in March 2023, people in younger age groups were less likely than those in older age groups to have had ESI, and U.S. citizens were much more likely than non-citizens to have had ESI. ESI coverage also varied across race and ethnic categories: compared to Non-Hispanic White people, Hispanic people and Non-Hispanic people who are Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native or of mixed race were less likely to have had ESI.",
            "For workers to have access to ESI, they need to work for an employer that offers ESI and they need to be eligible to enroll in coverage offered at their job. About four in five (80.8%) adult non-elderly workers worked for an employer that offered ESI to at least some employees in March 2023. A large majority (93.1%) of these workers were eligible for the ESI offered at their job, so that, overall, about three-in-four workers were eligible to enroll in ESI offered at their job.",
            "Both the share of workers working for employers offering coverage and the share eligible for coverage at their jobs vary significantly by income. Among adult non-elderly workers, the share working for an employer offering ESI ranged from 60.6% for workers with incomes under 200% of poverty to 88.2% for workers with incomes of 400% of poverty or more while the share eligible for coverage ranged from 49.5% for workers with incomes under 200% of poverty to 84.6% for workers with incomes of 400% of poverty or more.",
            "The share of non-elderly adult workers working for an employer that offers ESI was steady between 2019 and 2023. The share of these workers eligible for ESI at their job rose modestly over period, from 73.4% in March 2019 to 75.3% in March 2023.",
            "Among non-elderly adult workers, those working in construction, service, sales, and farm, fishing and forestry-related occupations were less likely to be working for an employer offering ESI and to be eligible for ESI at their jobs in March 2023. Full-time workers were much more likely to be working for an employer offering ESI and to be eligible for coverage at their job.",
            "Among non-elderly adult workers, women, non-citizens and younger workers were less likely than their counterparts to be eligible for ESI at their job in March 2023. Compared to White Non-Hispanic people, Hispanic people and Non-Hispanic Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native people were less likely to be eligible for ESI at work. Eligibility rates were particularly low for younger and non-citizen workers.",
            "Among non-elderly adult workers who were eligible for ESI at their jobs in March 2023, 74.4% were ESI policyholders. Of those who did not have ESI from their own job, 14.6% had ESI as a dependent, 4.6% had Medicaid or other public coverage, 2.0% had non-group coverage, 1.1% had some other coverage and 3.7%were uninsured.",
            "A small share of workers with ESI from their job also had other coverage at the same time: 2.4% also had Medicaid or other public coverage and 0.6% also had non-group coverage.",
            "Among non-elderly adult workers who were eligible for ESI at work but did not take it, 66.9% said the reason was that they had other coverage and 28.0% said the reason was that it was too expensive, and small shares cited other reasons.",
            "About 33.1 million non-elderly adult workers were not eligible for ESI at their job in March 2023. Of these workers, about 22.1 million worked full time and 11.1 million worked part time. Fewer than one-in-four (22.5%) worked for an employer that offered coverage to other workers.",
            "Among non-elderly adult full-time workers who were not eligible for ESI at their job in March 2023, more than half worked in one of six occupations: construction and extraction, food preparation and serving, transportation and material moving, sales, office and administration, and management. One-in-nine of these workers, or 2.8 million people, work in construction and extraction occupations alone.",
            "Employer-based health coverage is the largest source of health coverage for non-elderly people, covering 164.7 million people in March 2023, but its reach is uneven. In particular, ESI covered only 23.9% of non-elderly people with incomes less than 200% of poverty, compared to 84.2% of people with incomes of 400% of poverty or more.",
            "People’s access to ESI depends on the availability and cost of coverage where they or a family member work. A large share (75.3%) of workers are eligible for coverage offered at their job, but this again is uneven. Workers with low incomes as well as workers who were younger, women, working part-time, or non-citizens were each less likely to be eligible for ESI at their jobs than their counterparts. There were also differences across race and ethnic groups, where Hispanic people and Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaskan Native people had much lower rates of eligibility at work. Also, some workers eligible for ESI at work chose not to take it because they felt it was too expensive. For small businesses in particular, worker contributions for family coverage can be quiteexpensive.",
            "In the previous chartcollection, concern was raised that the job and other economic dislocations from COVID-19 could result in a meaningful loss of ESI. This did not occur, as the share of non-elderly people with ESI across the period has fluctuated only modestly (Chart 1). It is possible that COVID-19 interrupted an upward trend in ESI, but there is no way to know that. The share of workers eligible for ESI at their job increased over the period, from 73.4% in March 2019 to 75.3% in March 2023. This may portend higher ESI enrollment in future years, particularly if employment and job growth remain strong.",
            "",
            "[1]Data from the 2020 CPS ASEC was not included due to concerns about the COVID-19 impact on data collection and the reliability of the estimates for ESI, see:https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/2020/demo/sehsd-wp2020-13.pdf",
            "[2]The ASEC asks about each type of health coverage held at the time of the survey and at any time during the prior year. This brief uses the time of survey response, which is consistent with the time period for the questions about offer and eligibility. The ASEC is collected between February and April of each year, with most of the interviews conducted in March. This chart collection refers to March as the timing of the survey for convenience.",
            "[3]As noted, the results from the 2020 ASEC are not included due to concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on data collection. The 2020 ASEC showed a statistically significant increase in the share of non-elderly people with ESI to 61.5%.",

            "In late 2020, Congress passed and President Trump signed theNo Surprises Actestablishing new federal protections for consumers from surprise medical bills. The law became effective in 2022. A significant component of the law was to hold consumers harmless for surprise, out-of-network medical bills by creating a process where the medical provider and health plan would negotiate a payment for the service provided or end up in anindependent dispute resolution (IDR) process.",
            "",
            "About 1 in 8 disputes in the first year of the No Surprises Act arbitration process resulted in payment determinations",
            "Over300,000surprise billing disputes were initiated through the federal IDR process starting in April 2022 through March 2023. Disputes in the first year far exceeded CMS’sinitialestimate of less than 18,000 for the year.",
            "About 1 in 8 (13%) disputes during the first year of the IDR process received payment determinations. Another 19% of disputes were closed due to ineligibility or for other reasons. Disputes may be ineligible, for example, if state law applies, it’s not qualified under the No Surprises Act, or due to submission errors. Disputes can be closed for other reasons like if the parties settled or withdrew, or failed to pay fees. Nearly 7 in 10 disputes (68%) remained outstanding.",

            "Access & Affordability",
            "About7 in 10payment determinations were in favor of theproviders’ asking priceand the remaining were in favor of the health plans’ payment offer. (Based on an earlier governmentreport, nearly all of the dispute initiators are providers.) Even though most payment determinations through the federal IDR arbitration process have been in favor of providers, most of the lawsuits against the No Surprises Act are also being brought by providers.",
            "The federal government recently proposed severalchangeswith the goal of making the IDR process more efficient and increasing early communication between the parties.",

            "Provider groups have sued regarding the No Surprises Act and its implementation inseverallawsuits. District court rulings have set aside the requirement that IDR entities presume the Qualifying Payment Amount (QPA), defined as the median in-network rate in the region for the item or service, is the appropriate payment rate absent additional information. A district court decision also vacated certain provisions related to the QPA calculation methodology, and the federal government intends toappealthis decision. In the meantime, federal agenciesannouncedthat they do not plan to enforce court-required changes to the QPA methodology until May 2024. A district court ruling also vacated theadministrative feeincreases established in guidance. In response, the federal government has issued aproposed ruleto set administrative fees through formal notice and comment rulemaking. Otherlawsuits, including challenges to specific IDR payment decisions, are pending.",
            "As a result of the court decisions, the IDR process has beenhaltedseveral times.

            "Telehealth use surged with the COVID-19 pandemic as patients sought access to services while providers implemented social distancing protocols. Early in the pandemic, many payers eased restrictions on the use of telehealth and increased reimbursement rates to encourage its use.",
            "An ongoing question is how the growth of telehealth will affect health spending. If payers reimburse services provided through telehealth at a lower rate, there could be cost savings. Conversely, total spending could increase if telehealth services require more follow-up and are duplicative of in-person care.",
            "In 2021, as was the case in 2020, private insurers continued to pay providers similarly for telehealth and in-person professional claims, on average. This is true for both evaluation and management and mental health therapy services. Among providers who offered both telehealth and in-person care, the vast majority of providers received similar payments regardless of whether the service was provided in-person or over telehealth.",
            "In 2021, the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, private insurers continued to pay providers a similar amount regardless of whether that care was delivered in person or via telemedicine. For a mid-level severity evaluation and management of an existing patient, the average payment was $99 when delivered via telehealth and $98 for in-person care. This represents the average amount paid by the health plan combined with the out-of-pocket payment by the enrollee, after controlling for providers and regions (see methods for more detail). Evaluation and management claims are the most common claims included as part of an outpatient medical visit and cover the charge for a physician or qualified provider to diagnose and treat a patient. One encounter may include multiple evaluation and management claims, depending on the services rendered.",
            "Payments to providers tend to be higher for new patients than existing ones and for higher severity claims. Payments for telehealth evaluation and management claims were similar to those for in-person care across all levels of severity and for both new and established patients with private insurance in 2021, as was the case in 2020.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Care for higher severity level and new patients was more frequently delivered in-person than virtually. For evaluation and management claims, 18% of claims for established patients were by telehealth, compared to 8% of new patient claims.",
            "During the pandemic, telehealth became a key way by which people access mental health care, in particular. In 2021, most mental health therapy (54%) was delivered by telehealth. Before the pandemic, a small share of claims were delivered over telehealth.",
            "Across all evaluation and management claims, which include physical and behavioral evaluation and management services, 11% of care was delivered via telehealth in 2021.",
            "For common mental health therapy claims, the average payment was about the same regardless of whether the service was delivered by telehealth or in-person in 2021, as was the case in 2020.",
            "Higher severity or longer duration mental health therapy claims were delivered in-person and over telehealth at similar rates.",
            "Among the overwhelming majority of providers offering the same service by telehealth and in-person, the average paid amount for claims delivered over telehealth was within plus or minus 10% of the payment for in-person claims. For 5% of providers offering other evaluation and management services and 10% of providers offering mental health therapy, the payment for telehealth was lower than in-person care by the same provider by at least 10%. Conversely, for about 1 in 10 providers, the payment for telehealth claims was more than 10% higher than that for in-person care by the same provider.",
            "According to the2022 KFF Survey of Employer Health Benefits, most employers (59%) provide telemedicine coverage exclusively through their health plans or administrators. Large firms (32%) are more likely to use a specialized telemedicine provider than small firms (21%).",
            "In 2022, 3 in 4 (76%) employers reported to the KFF employersurveythat they expect current levels of telehealth use to either continue or increase.",
            "Private insurer payments for telehealth professional claims were similar to in-person for some common services in 2021, as they were in 2020. While private insurers and employers were paying about the same amounts for in-person and telehealth in 2020, it was unclear whether they would continue to do so in 2021. If telehealth payments continue to be the same as those for in-person care, this raises questions as to whether telehealth will reduce the spending on common health services, as some have predicted.",
            "The primary benefit to expanding telehealth may be increased access to services and convenience for enrollees. This analysis does not consider reduced patient travel costs or wait times, improved efficiencies in providers’ overhead costs, changes in the rates of laboratory or other ancillary services provided, the clinical effectiveness of the telehealth service, or overall changes in access to care. This analysis did not assess the extent to which telehealth can replace in-person services or its impact on overall use, quality of care, or spending.",
            "Telehealthvisits, particularly formental health, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to expansion of telehealth coverage and easing of state and federal rules relating to telehealth practice and reimbursement. In this analysis, over half of mental health claims were delivered over telehealth.",
            "Several federal and state actions are aimed at extending telehealth coverage, payment parity, access, and provider scope of practice after the pandemic. Examples of bills in Congress include:",
            "Telehealth use surged during the pandemic, but thefuture of telehealthwill be shaped by its effect on total health spending, federal and state regulations relating to scope of practice and reimbursement, and payer coverage and reimbursement policies.",
            "Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) claims data professional claims file for the 2021 calendar year was used in this analysis. Enrollees with employer-sponsored health insurance and physician claims paid as primary coverage were included. Evaluation and management claims in the professional physician file were identified based on CPT codes (99202-99205, 99211-99215). CPT code 99201 for new patients with the lowest level of complexity was deleted starting in 2021. Mental health therapy claims in the professional physician file were identified based on CPT codes (90791-92, 90832-90839, 90846, 90847, 90853). Telehealth claims were flagged based on presence of a modifier code (95, GT, GQ, G0) or place of service code (02) on the claim line. Claim lines with less than $10 or over $1,000 in paid amounts were excluded.",
            "The average paid amount (plan payment plus member cost sharing) at the claim-line level was regressed on telehealth indicator with provider identifier fixed effects. Separate models were run for each CPT code.",
            "For the fifth chart comparing differences in telehealth and in-person claims allowed amount among providers offering the same service over both, KFF compared average claims payments within each provider offering both in-person and telehealth services. The average amount paid was compared for CPT codes with highest frequency claims: evaluation and management established patient severity level 3 (CPT code 99213) and psychotherapy 60 minutes (CPT code 90837). Providers with 15 or fewer telehealth or in-person claims were excluded. This comparison includes over 90,000 unique provider NPIs for CPT code 99213, and over 50,000 provider NPIs for the mental health therapy code 90837.",
            "Some limitations of this analysis are that KFF did not assess whether telehealth appeared to supplement or duplicate in-person care, nor did KFF assess whether telehealth was associated with more or fewer ancillary services or follow-up visits. Rather, KFF simply compared paid amounts for each claim service code. Telehealth may reduce a patient’s wait time and travel costs, which was also not studied here. Additionally, it is not clear going forward whether insurers will continue to reimburse for telehealth at a similar rate as in-person care, or whether this was a temporary decision during the early pandemic when there was relatively low utilization of care overall and a compelling reason to avoid in-person care.",

            "Spending on retail prescription drugs hasincreased rapidly since1960, accelerating inthe 1990s.Adjusted for inflation,retail prescription drug spendingper capitain the U.S. increased from $101 in 1960 to $1,147in 2021.",
            "In contrast to hospital and physician spending, out-of-pocket prescription drug spending has declined since the mid-2000s. Additionally, out-of-pocket prescription drug spending is expected to decline by 8% by 2031, while physician and hospital spending are projected to increase by 43% and 44%, respectively.",

            "In 2021, per capita out-of-pocket spending on retail prescription drugs, hospitals, and physician services each increased slightly from the previous year. Out-of-pocket spending per capita for physician services experienced the largest percent increase at 9% (from $183 per capita in 2020 to $199 per capita in 2021) as services resumed after a drop in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail prescription drug out-of-pocket spending per capita remained the same from 2019 to 2020 and then slightly increased in 2021 ($147 per capita in 2019, $147 in 2020, and $151 in 2021). Per capita out-of-pocket spending on hospital services increased slightly from 2020 to 2021 as well ($98 per capita in 2020 and $103 per capita in 2021).",

            "Due to the way drugs are selected for inclusion in the price index, it can take some time for new drugs to be incorporated into the index. The price index for drugs has held relatively stable since the mid-1990s (ranging in growth from about 1% to 5% annually), while the utilization index has changed more over time.",

            "The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, includes numerous provisions aimed atprescriptiondrug spendingfor patients withMedicare. These provisions include capping insulin cost-sharing to $35 per month (effective 2023), requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to Medicare if their prices rise faster than inflation (rebate payments required starting in 2023), capping Medicare Part D out-of-pocket drug spending to $2,000 annually (effective starting in 2025), and requiring the federal government to negotiate prices for certain high-spend drugs covered by Medicare (negotiated prices take effect in 2026).",

CMS actuaries expect a 20 percent reduction in aggregate drug costs from drug price negotiations and inflation rebates. CBO estimates that the drug pricing provisions in the law will reduce the federal deficit by$237 billionover 10 years (2022-2031).",

CMS now expects out-of-pocket drug spending to peak in 2023 at $52.5 billion and decline thereafter through 2027 as provisions take effect. By 2030, total out-of-pocket spending on retail prescription drugs is projected to be $48.1 billion, 18.5% lower than the $59.0 billion projected previously.

            "Health insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.",
            "For 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.",
            "Among 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of –15% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.",
            "The rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.",
            "The chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "As is the case in most years, medical trend – which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care – is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.",
            "Of the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.",
            "“The primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.  The increases are associated with increases in the “unit” cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or “utilization”, by members.”– Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky",
            "While health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been anexception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.",
            "Looking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.",
            "“Significant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.”– Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island",
            "“We expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.”– Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington",
            "“Health insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members’ medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.”– Highmark, New York",
            "In addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers’ administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.",
            "“Blue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups.This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.” –Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont",
            "This year, as they did inprioryears,insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will becommercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.",
            "“MVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.”– MVP Health Care, VT",
            "“Costs related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.” – Molina Healthcare of Washington",
            "The pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.",
            "“While 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.”– Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington",
            "Few insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.",
            "On April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible forsubsidies.",
            "About half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.",
            "“Our assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.”– Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont",
            "A relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.",
            "“Medicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.” –BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon",
            "Some other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:",
            "Diabetes and Weight Loss Drugs.Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given theincreasing costand use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.",
            "The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).The IRA extends pandemic-era enhancedsubsidiesthrough 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.",
            "Other federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.  None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the “family glitch” in their filings.",
            "Similar tolast year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.",
            "A key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.",
            "Many insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.",
            "Relative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and theNo Surprises Act,were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts onenrollmentandcosts.",
            "Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.",

            "Millions of people in the United States live with mental health diagnoses, with aboutone thirdof adults reporting symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Among these adults, over 20% report anunmet needfor counseling or therapy.",
            "Private insurance covers the majority of nonelderly adults (58%) in the United States, and many enrollees experiencedifficultyaffording care and navigating their coverage. Additionally, people with private insurance oftenfacechallengesfinding mental health care providers in their insurance networks and are more likely to goout-of-networkorself-payfor mental health services compared to other health care services.",
            "In this brief, we explore health spending among privately insured adults treated for depression and/or anxiety. We include nonelderly adults with large employer plans using claims from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database in 2021. These findings only include services that enrollees claim under their employer coverage, and we are therefore likely underestimating utilization of, and spending on, mental health services.",
            "Enrollees who were treated for depression and/or anxiety in 2021 had almost twice as much annual out-of-pocket spending compared to enrollees who were not treated for a mental health diagnosis ($1,501 versus $863). Out-of-pocket spending and service utilization increased with depression severity. Mental health conditions oftenco-occurwith physical health problems, so increased spending may reflect worse physical health in addition to mental health. Psychotherapy was the most common, and most costly outpatient service, with annual costs totaling $1,507 on average per enrollee (including $348 out-of-pocket), though this does not include any therapy where the enrollee paid fully out-of-pocket without submitting a claim to their insurer. We also find that the majority of psychotherapy (61%), psychiatric office visits (66%), and other mental health office visits (51%) were delivered via telemedicine in 2021, compared to less than 1% before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "We look at health spending for two common mental health diagnoses: depression and generalized anxiety disorder (to which we refer as “anxiety” throughout). In 2021, 9% of adults with large employer private insurance had a documented diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety in their outpatient or inpatient care.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "We find that privately insured enrollees treated for depression and/or anxiety had almost twice as much out-of-pocket spending in 2021 compared to their counterparts with no mental health diagnoses ($1,501 versus $863). Further, total annual spending – which includes out-of-pocket costs plus the portion paid by insurance plans – was 1.9 times as much as for enrollees with depression and/or anxiety compared to their counterparts ($11,701 vs. $6,174).",
            "In part, these differences are due to greater use of services. For example, on average, enrollees with a documented depression and/or anxiety diagnosis had more than twice as many office visits in 2021 than enrollees with no mental health diagnoses (7.4 visits versus 3.2 visits).",
            "We categorized depression severity as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the highest level of depression for which an enrollee was treated in 2021. Of all enrollees with depression (with or without co-occurring anxiety), 21% were treated for severe depression, 56% were treated for moderate depression, and 23% were treated for mild depression.",
            "Enrollees with more severe depression spent more on outpatient care than their counterparts. For example, enrollees with severe depression diagnoses had 40% higher out-of-pocket costs during 2021 than those with mild depression ($1,930 vs. $1,382) and 124% higher out-of-pocket costs than those with no mental health diagnosis. Enrollees with severe depression averaged $17,546 in total annual health spending (including the amount covered by insurance and paid out-of-pocket), compared to $10,464 for enrollees with mild depression.",
            "Enrollees treated for depression and/or anxiety in 2021 spent the majority of their out-of-pocket costs on outpatient care (78% of out-of-pocket spending), which was similar to enrollees with no mental health diagnoses (75%). Among enrollees treated for depression and/or anxiety, the majority of this outpatient annual spending was for services related to physical health care, rather than to mental health care (mental health services are defined as claims for which the primary diagnosis is a mental health disorder). On average, $376 (or 32%) of outpatient out-of-pocket spending among enrollees with depression and/or anxiety was for mental health services.",
            "Enrollees with more severe depression spent a larger share of their outpatient annual spending on mental health services. For example, enrollees with severe depression spent $578, or 40% of their outpatient out-of-pocket spending on mental health services (not including payments for services that enrollees do not claim under their employer coverage). Conversely, enrollees with mild depression spent $290, or 27%, of their outpatient out-of-pocket spending on mental health services.",
            "In general, health plans covered a larger share of outpatient non-mental health services compared to outpatient mental health services. Overall, enrollees with depression and/or anxiety paid for 20% of their outpatient mental health services out-of-pocket, with their health plans covering 80%. However, for their outpatient non-mental health services, enrollees with depression and/or anxiety paid 13% out-of-pocket, on average, with their health plans paying 87% of the overall cost. Many common outpatient services are classified aspreventive services, which health plans are required to cover with no cost-sharing. Therefore, some of this difference could be because a larger share of non-mental health services are preventive. This is one way in which there may not be true parity in mental health coverage in practice.",
            "On average, among all enrollees treated for depression and/or anxiety, 18% had a psychiatry office visit during the year, 54% had psychotherapy, and 45% had another type of mental health office visit (defined as non-psychiatrist office visits where the primary diagnosis is for a mental health condition). However, this does not include services for which enrollees self-pay and do not submit a claim to their insurer.",
            "Enrollees with severe depression were 3 times more likely to see a psychiatrist than enrollees with mild depression (36% vs 12%). However, for mental health office visits (non-psychiatrist), enrollees with severe depression were only 1.3 times as likely to have a visit compared to enrollees with mild depression (54% vs 42%).",
            "As demonstrated during of the COVID-19 pandemic, flexibilities offered bytelemedicinecan help address some of the need for health care, particularly for behavioral health services. The growth in telemedicine for behavioral health visits outpaced other types of care early in the pandemic. Previous KFF analyses found that55%of employers who offer health benefits believe telemedicine is important to providing access to mental health care.",
            "We found that for enrollees with depression and/or anxiety, roughly half of non-psychiatry office visits (51%) for primary mental health diagnoses, were delivered via telemedicine in 2021. A larger share of psychiatry visits (66%) and psychotherapy visits (61%) were delivered via telemedicine. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, less than 1% of these services were delivered via telemedicine.",
            "Overall, mental health services were more likely to be delivered via telemedicine than other outpatient services. For people with no mental health diagnoses, only 9% of outpatient office visits in 2021 were telemedicine.",
            "Among enrollees who were treated for depression and/or anxiety in 2021, psychotherapy was the most expensive commonly used outpatient mental health service. These enrollees paid, on average, $348 out-of-pocket for these services in 2021, and total annual spending averaged $1,507. On average, annual out-of-pocket costs for psychiatric office visits ($128) were more expensive than other mental health-related office visits ($96); differences were similarly reflected in average total annual costs. The annual cost of all mental health services included in this analysis increased with severity of depression. These averages exclude services that were not billed to an enrollee’s health plan.",
            "Among enrollees who were treated for depression and/or anxiety in 2021, 74% had at least one prescription for an antidepressant or anxiolytic medication. Antidepressants were more common (71% of enrollees) than anxiolytics (21% of enrollees). The likelihood of having a psychiatric medication prescription increased with the severity of depression. Eighty-four percent of enrollees treated for severe depression had an antidepressant prescription, versus 73% with mild depression. These medications had relatively low out-of-pocket costs for enrollees, averaging $6 for a one-month supply of an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication.",
            "We find that enrollees with depression and/or anxiety spend almost twice as much out-of-pocket on their annual health services overall, compared to those without a mental health diagnosis. Further, enrollees pay for a larger share of mental health services out-of-pocket compared to other health care services. However, for enrollees with depression and/or anxiety, most of their out-of-pocket spending is for non-mental health services (70%). The relationship between mental health and health spending may be multi-directional. On one hand, those with mental health conditions require more care, and thus spend more. On the other hand,chronic health conditionsandhigh health spendingat baseline may lead people to develop secondary depression and/or anxiety. There is a high rate ofco-occurrencebetween mental health conditions and other chronic physical conditions.",
            "Even with private insurance, many adults with mental health conditions do not receive needed care – among adults with employer insurance and moderate to severe symptoms of depression and/or anxiety,37%did not receive treatment. High costs can often lead people to delay or forgo needed health services. For example, despitemental health parity regulations,networkadequacyissues persist, leaving many people toseekcareoutside of theirinsurance networks. Having to go out of network can substantially increase costs for individuals (and these costs are not captured in this analysis). In 2022,employersreported that their networks for mental health care were narrower than their overall provider networks, and only 44% believed their network of providers could meet their employees’ needs. Few large employers have added virtual or in-personmental health providersto their networks. This may reflect the ongoing provider shortage, with a high percentage ofunmet needfor mental health providers nationally.",
            "These findings of higher health spending among privately insured individuals receiving treatment for depression and/or anxiety come at a time of rising health costs. Health insurance is already expensive for enrollees with private insurance, and treatment for mental health conditions can further escalate these costs.",
            "This analysis is based on 2021 claims from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, which contains claims information provided by a sample of large employer plans. In 2021, there were claims for over 13 million of the 85 million people in the large group market. To make MarketScan data representative of large group plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Adults less than 65 years old with continuous enrollment in their plan for at least six months were included.",
            "Enrollees were included if their annual spending was between $0 and the 99.5th percentile of annual spending. Total spending is the sum of the amount paid by the insurer and the amount paid by the enrollee. Out-of-pocket expenses are a sum of coinsurance, copays, and deductibles where applicable. The MarketScan database includes only claims covered by the enrollees’ plan and does not include services for which enrollees paid directly without the health plan being billed, claims denied by the health plan, any balance billing directly from providers to enrollees.",
            "Enrollees with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or mild, moderate, or severe depression were identified if they had at least one inpatient or outpatient claim with a target primary diagnosis. Depression with psychotic features and depression in remission were excluded. Enrollees were categorized as mild, moderate or severe depression based on their most severe inpatient or outpatient claim during the year. GAD is not categorized by severity level in ICD-10 diagnosis codes, so we are unable to look at differences between mild, moderate, and severe anxiety in this analysis. Enrollees with the target diagnoses were compared against enrollees with no treatment for any mental health diagnosis during the year. Therefore, enrollees with mental health diagnoses other than depression or anxiety do not appear in this analysis.",
            "Specific services were identified usingCurrent Procedural Terminology(CPT) codes, and office visits were classified as psychiatry versus other using standard provider and revenue codes. For services such as office visits, which can be for mental health or non-mental health diagnoses, services were classified as mental health if the primary diagnosis on the outpatient claim was for a mental health ICD-10 diagnosis code. Telemedicine claims were identified using CPT modifier codes and place of service codes. Add-on CPT codes for prolonged services that may be applied to outpatient office visits and therapy were not included because linking the add-on code to a specific service is inexact in claims data. Sensitivity analysis including and excluding add-on codes for outpatient services found negligible differences in average annual costs and utilization.",
            "This analysis is limited in several ways. First, we only capture services that are billed to enrollees’ insurance plans, so any payments directly from enrollees to providers are not included, including self-pay psychiatry or psychotherapy services. We also do not include denied claims or balance billing directly from providers to enrollees. Given that in-network mental health services can bedifficulttoaccess, we are likely undercounting the true utilization rate and cost of psychiatric services in this population. Second, drug costs do not include rebates paid from pharmaceutical companies to insurers, so actual payments for psychiatric medications may be lower than reported in this analysis. While we show that enrollees with depression and/or anxiety have higher health spending than enrollees without a mental health diagnosis, we are unable to say whether mental health treatment is driving increased annual spending, or whether increased annual spending (and worse underlying chronic health) is causing higher rates of depression and anxiety.",

            "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most private health plans to cover in-networkpreventive servicesat $0 cost-sharing for enrollees. This preventive services coverage mandate was ruled partially unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas inBraidwood Management v. Becerra.On March 30, 2023, the Texas district court excluded from the requirement all preventive care recommendations issued by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) on or after March 23, 2010, when the ACA was signed into law. (For examples of preventive care services that may be affected by the Braidwood district court ruling, seehere.)",
            "The Biden administration is appealing this decision. On May 15, 2023, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrativestay, putting a temporary pause on the effect of the Texas district court ruling. Separately, and prior to the stay, major private health insurersannouncedthat they do not plan to make changes to coverage of preventive services until a final ruling has been made. Some insurers and employers may introduce cost sharing over time if the district court ruling holds.",
            "In this analysis, we find that at least 1 in 20 privately insured people (5.7%) received any of the ACA preventive services or drugs potentially affected byBraidwoodTexas district court ruling. According to the American Community Survey, 173 million non-elderly people have private health insurance coverage. Based on this, we estimate up to nearly 10 million people could face higher out-of-pocket costs if the district court ruling stands and insurers ultimately decide to implement cost-sharing.",
            "We use similar methods for analyzing preventive care utilization as thoseoutlinedin a KFF/RTI brief published before the district court’s ruling. In this analysis, we use 2019 claims data to reflect utilization in a typical pre-pandemic year. We use this older data becausepreventive services utilizationchanged significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We focus on most of the preventive services and drugs withmajor changesto USPSTF recommendations after 2010, though other services may also be affected by the district court ruling. This analysis specifically includes:",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Since we are using 2019 data, our analysis does not include more recent USPSTF recommendations, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for adults at risk for HIV (recommended in June 2019) and colorectal cancer screenings for average-risk adults ages 45 through 49 (recommended in May 2021).",
            "In 2019, 7.0% of people enrolled in the individual market (those purchasing health coverage directly through ACA exchanges or health plan websites) received preventive care affected byBraidwooddistrict court decision. Slightly smaller shares of people who are insured through a large employer (5.7%) or a small employer (4.1%) received these preventive services and drugs. Statins were the most commonly used form of ACA preventive care potentially affected byBraidwooddistrict court ruling.",
            "While the Fifth Circuit Court’s stay is in effect, the federal government can continue to enforce the ACA preventive services mandate for everyone except the plaintiffs in the case. If the Fifth Circuit Court stay is lifted and the district court’s decision is affirmed by a higher court, insurers would be allowed to introduce cost-sharing for any of the affected preventive services and drugs or exclude coverage altogether, though the latter appears to be the less likely scenario.",
            "Though we estimate about 10 million people received any of these forms of preventive care at $0 cost-sharing in 2019, we do not include colorectal cancer screenings for adults in their late 40s or PrEP, which were recommended on or after 2019. As a result, the number of people who could be affected by cost-sharing or coverage loss for these services may be higher than this analysis shows. While the total number of people on PrEP is relatively small (366,458in 2021), the majority (an estimated81%) have private health coverage and are potentially impacted by this case.  The cost of PrEP drugs, labs, and provider visits can behigh. Similarly, colonoscopies can be quite expensive, averaging over$1,000.",
            "Additionally, the ruling could affect more services and people over time – as new preventive services and drugs are developed, recommended, and adopted. If the higher courts fully side with the plaintiffs, the effects could be more sweeping and open the door for future employer objections to other preventive services coverage at $0 cost share. Our earlier analysis with RTI international found 6 in 10 privately insured people, or about100 million people, received services covered under the ACA preventive services mandate in a typical year and discusses further implications of this case.",

            "The federal requirement that private health plans cover COVID-19 tests ordered or administered by a clinician at no out-of-pocket charge to consumers will end with the public health emergency (PHE) on May 11, 2023. During the PHE, private insurers were also required to reimburse for up to 8 at-home rapid tests per member per month starting January 15, 2022; this requirement will also end with the PHE. A temporary Medicaid coverage option adopted by18 states and U.S. territorieshas given people without insurance access to COVID-19 testing services, including at-home tests, without cost-sharing; as this program ends with the PHE, they no longer have guarantees of free testing. More information on changes to test coverage resulting from the end of the PHE can be foundhere.",
            "Though the vast majority of people with private health coverage will continue to have coverage for COVID-19 tests ordered or administered by a clinician, those tests may soon be subject to cost sharing (deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance), quantity limits, and prior authorization requirements. And, while some health plans may voluntarily continue to cover at-home tests, plans won’t be required by federal law to do so. Therefore, people with health insurance may face the full cost of tests, if those individuals are within their deductible, subject to quantity limits, denied coverage through prior authorization, or purchase an at-home test that is not covered through their insurance. People without health insurance will face the full cost of COVID-19 tests if performed in the typical clinical setting. Testing may still be available through free or community clinics, provided they continue past the end of the PHE.",
            "In this analysis, we use various data sources to look at prices for COVID-19 tests performed in an outpatient clinical setting and at home. We examine commercial health plan payments for outpatient COVID-19 tests among people with large employer-based health coverage claims using 2021 Merative MarketScan data. We also look at self-pay cash prices (which would apply to uninsured people) for COVID-19 tests in the hospital price transparency data aggregated by Turquoise Health. Lastly, we review prices for rapid at-home COVID-19 tests available online from a sample of retailers. We do not look at the prices paid by Medicare or Medicaid programs using claims or hospital price transparency data.",
            "We find that the median price of a COVID-19 test in an outpatient clinical setting was $45 in 2021 among people with large employer-based health coverage, though prices varied widely. Among hospitals disclosing price transparency data, the median discounted hospital-based self-pay rate was $51 for a COVID-19 antigen test (CPT 87426) and $91 for a PCR test (CPT 87635). We find that recent prices for at-home rapid COVID-19 tests average about $11 per test.",

            "We reviewed variation in large employer health plan prices for COVID-19 tests (antigen or PCR) reported in 2021 MarketScan outpatient data. These were for the test itself in outpatient facility and professional claims and do not include any other cost associated with the test, such as the cost of a physician visit or a specimen collection fee. (In terms of visit costs, our earlieranalysisfound that the typical commercial health plan payment for a physician visit is $93 in-person and $94 by telehealth.)",
            "Across all types of COVID-19 tests in the outpatient clinical setting, the median price was $45 in 2021 among people with large employer-based private health plans. Half of the prices fell between $35 and $66.",
            "Factors that affected the price include the test type (antigen vs. PCR) as well as whether additional respiratory pathogens (e.g., influenza) were included as part of a test panel. However, prices also varied within various types of diagnostic tests. Generally, antigen testing was cheaper than PCR testing, with a median price of $42 for antigen testing compared to $62 for PCR testing. In this sample of large employer health plan enrollees, antigen tests comprised 60% of all COVID-19 tests ordered in 2021. When COVID-19 was part of a respiratory panel, the median price was $76 (testing for all pathogens combined) compared to $45 just for COVID.",
            "",
            "We also examined self-pay cash prices among hospitals whose hospital price transparency data were aggregated by Turquoise Health. These data are posted to comply with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) price transparency requirements, and include reporting of cash prices, commercial negotiated rates, and list prices. Although not directly comparable to the large employer-based health plan prices, which are for tests conducted in the outpatient clinical settings, the self-pay rates give us an idea of what costs uninsured patients may be exposed to if receiving COVID-19 testing at a hospital or hospital-related outpatient setting. The median self-pay rate was $51 for a COVID-19 antigen test (CPT 87426) and $91 for a PCR test (CPT 87635).",
            "Hospitals’ median self-pay rates varied by state. COVID-19 PCR testing was the most expensive in Alaska, with the median self-pay rate at $200, and least expensive in Utah, with the median self-pay rate at $41. Self-pay rates were not calculated by state for antigen tests since some states had very few hospitals reporting.",
            "",
            "We scanned websites for 6 major retailers to examine variations in prices for at-home COVID-19 rapid tests. We find the average price for rapid at-home COVID-19 tests was $11 per test across retailers. Most at-home rapid COVID tests cost between $12-$24 per pack and contain two tests per pack. The total cost for a pack of COVID-19 tests ranged from $8 (1-test pack) to $40 (4-test pack). Costs were similar compared to those found in the2022 searches.",
            "COVID-19 tests, performed in a clinical setting or at home, became more accessible during the pandemic and are now a mainstay of preventing the spread of COVID-19 and identifying those who may need access to treatment. Early in the pandemic, test availability and accessibility was challenging, including forat-home testing. While much testing has moved to at-home rapid COVID-19 tests, many people continue to seek COVID-19 testing in clinical settings, either for confirmation of at-home results or as part of a diagnostic workup. After thePHEends on May 11, 2023,federal lawno longer protects insurance enrollees from cost sharing, prior authorization, or other forms of medical management in coverage ofCOVID-19 tests, either at home or in a clinical setting. Loss of coverage for millions of people with theending of continuous enrollmentfor Medicaid enrollees, coupled with lapsing coverage of COVID-19 testing for people without insurance in states that had temporarily extended coverage, means many more people may bear the entire cost of COVID-19 testing.",
            "This analysis finds typical private insurance payment for diagnostic laboratory COVID-19 tests is about $45 and typical self-pay cash price at hospitals is $51 for an antigen test and $91 for a PCR test. Prices for at-home COVID-19 testing average $11 per test, though consumers typically purchase a set including multiple tests which increases this cost. Moving ahead, enrollee cost sharing for COVID-19 tests in a clinical setting will depend on their health plan and where they receive a test. In instances where the health plan applies a deductible or if the test is performed out-of-network, the enrollee could face the full costs.",
            "People receiving a test in a clinical setting will likely be subject to additional charges, such as physician visit costs (which, in an earlieranalysiswe found averaged $93 for an office visit) and/or specimen collection fees. Cost sharing for a visit solely for COVID-19 testing was prohibited in the past but may now apply after the end of the PHE. A person either privately insured within their deductible or uninsured seeking an outpatient office visit for a COVID-19 test could see a cost of approximately $130-150, including office visit fees and COVID-19 testing. People without health insurance would be liable for the entire cost of the COVID-19 test and associated visit in most circumstances.",
            "While tests ordered within a clinical setting will generally be covered, albeit potentially with cost-sharing, this is not the case for at-home tests. Consumers will likely have to pay the full cost of at-home tests, as with other types of at-home testing. Although there have been federally purchased tests available for free, the supply has dwindled. Prices identified in this analysis were in the context of federal policy that provides these tests free to the consumer; it is unclear if prices will change once coverage of these tests concludes with the PHE.",
            "Out-of-pocket costs can accumulate over the course of multiple tests needed for multiple family members. Even nominal cost sharing and out-of-pocket expenses for at-home tests may add up to prohibitive sums, alter testing behavior, or result indelayed or forgone care.",
            "Merative MarketScan outpatient claims data for 2021 were used to analyze commercial health plan payments for outpatient COVID-19 tests in this analysis. To make MarketScan data representative of large group health plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age, state, and whether the enrollee was a policy holder or dependent. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range. CPT codes corresponding with COVID-19 tests were classified by methodology: antigen (CPT 87426, 87428, 87811) and PCR (87635, 87636, 87637, 0202U, 0241U); as well as whether the code was solely for SARS-CoV-2 (87811, 87426, 87635, 0202U) or included other pathogens in a panel (87428, 87636, 87637, 0241U). Other CPT codes were examined but not included in the analysis due to low volumes. For distribution of commercial insurance prices, negative values and the top percentile  were trimmed.",
            "To look at self-pay cash price rates for hospitals, Turquoise Health price transparency data were used. Turquoise Health updates hospital price transparency data on a rolling basis to contain the most recent data possible. Rates used in this analysis ranged were aggregated by Turquoise Health between April 2021 and April 2023. Antigen and PCR testing refer to CPT codes 87426 and 87635, the most common codes for COVID-19 testing found in 2021 MarketScan outpatient claims for each test methodology respectively. Rates in the top and bottom percentile were trimmed. One of the challenges withhospital price transparency datais that the number of rates for a given rate type and code can vary. To prevent overweighting hospitals with more rates listed, the median self-pay rate for the hospital was first calculated to represent the hospital. Then, the median hospital rate in each state was calculated to represent the typical rate for the state.",
            "To estimate the price for at-home testing, we scanned websites for 6 major retailers (Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreens, Amazon, and Kroger) on April 20, 2023 with methodology similar to a previous KFFanalysis. For each retailer, all brands of available rapid antigen tests were included in the analysis except Amazon, where prices were recorded for brands that were available at the 5 other retailers.",

            "Although older adults have been at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from COVID-19, many younger people have had their lives cut short by the illness. And, while much attention has been paid to the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on people of color, it also is important to consider the prematurity of these deaths. As a measure of the impact of the pandemic, mortality rates alone do not tell the full story as they do not incorporate the age at death. One can also look at the premature mortality rate or the rate of death below a certain age. Another measure, years of life lost (derived from counts of deaths at each age that were in excess of deaths observed in typical years), measures the degree of prematurity of deaths during the pandemic.",
            "In this brief, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by race and ethnicity through the lens of premature mortality, using the measures of premature mortality rate and years of life lost among excess deaths that occurred during the pandemic.",
            "We count premature deaths as deaths that occurred before the person had reached age 75. This approach, discussed more in the Methods section, provides a uniform measure of the extent of premature death during the pandemic, although in a sense every death due to COVID-19 has been premature. Before the pandemic, most racial and ethnic groups hadlife expectanciesof about 75 years or longer, although American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) people had a life expectancy of 71.8 years. For the premature mortality rate, we calculate the all-cause, age-specific mortality rate for people under age 75 using weekly counts of death from 2015 to 2022.",
            "We also look at the number of years of life lost before age 75, basing this part of the analysis on excess mortality data from March 2020 through December 2022 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Excess deaths are those above CDC’s estimate of expected count based on pre-pandemic mortality averages. While most of the excess deaths during the pandemic have been due to COVID-19, deaths from drug overdose, suicide, heart disease, and liver disease also increased during this period. Here, we look at years of life lost due to all causes from March 2020 through the end of 2022. Using age 75 as a uniform benchmark is comparable to how OECD presents international comparisons of premature mortality. American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN) people had a lower average life expectancy before the pandemic than this age limit. Using the same age limit across groups avoids incorporating pre-existing disparities. The social and economic forces driving disparities during the pandemic are likely related to the lower life expectancy as well.",
            "While the pandemic has had devastating effects across all racial and ethnic groups, we find significant racial disparities in premature death during the pandemic. Consistent with pre-pandemic trends, some communities of color faced higher premature death rates during the pandemic than their White counterparts. For all groups of color, though, the pandemic was associated with a steeper increase in the premature death rate than for White people. The increase in the premature death rate for Hispanic people (33%) was over twice that of White people (14%) from 2019 to 2022.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "We also find, among excess deaths during the pandemic, people of color who died prematurely lost more years of life than White people, on average. For example, using excess mortality data, premature deaths among White people resulted in an average of 12.5 years of life lost, while premature deaths among Hispanic people resulted in 19.9 years of life lost and premature deaths among AIAN people resulted in an average of 22.0 years of life lost before age 75. While communities of color make up about 40% of the U.S. population, they experienced 59% of the years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "The premature mortality rate (mortality rate for people under age 75) by racial/ethnic group was relatively stable in the years leading up to the pandemic, although racial disparities existed. In 2019, the age-specific premature mortality rates of AIAN and Black communities were 537 and 553 per 100,000 people —somewhat higher than that of White people at 499 per 100,000 people.",
            "While all groups experienced an increase in premature mortality, the rate rose more for people of color than for White people. Between 2019 and 2022, the all-cause mortality rate among people under age 75 increased by 33% for Hispanic and AIAN people, 28% for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) people, 22% for Asian people, and 21% for Black people, in contrast to a 14% increase for White people. As of 2022, AIAN and Black people had the highest rates of premature mortality, while Hispanic and Asian people had the lowest rates of premature mortality, consistent with the pre-pandemic trends.",
            "Measures of years of life lost can provide information on how premature these deaths are. We find that among excess deaths from March 2020 through the end of 2022, people who died prematurely lost an average of 15.6 years of life before age 75.",
            "Among premature excess deaths during the pandemic, AIAN and Hispanic people lost the most years of life compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Premature excess deaths among AIAN people resulted in an average of 22.0 years of life lost and premature excess deaths among Hispanic people resulted in an average of 19.9 years of life lost. By comparison, White people lost an average of 12.5 years of life from premature excess deaths during the pandemic.",
            "Through the end of 2022, we estimate 14.8 million years of life were lost during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of excess deaths, with a disproportionately large share of these years of life being lost by people of color. We find that through the end of 2022, 6.1 million years of life were lost among White people, 3.9 million years of life were lost among Hispanic people, and 3.8 million years of life were lost among Black people. White and Asian people accounted for a smaller share of years of life lost compared to their share of the total U.S. population.",
            "In contrast, AIAN, Black, and Hispanic people made up larger shares of years of life lost due to excess deaths during the pandemic than their share of the total population. AIAN people made up 3% of total years of life lost but just 1% of the population. Black people made up 26% of the total years of life lost but just 13% of the population, and Hispanic people accounted for 27% of years of life lost in contrast to 19% of the population.",
            "Despite variation in rates of years of life lost over the course of the pandemic, AIAN, NHOPI, Black, and Hispanic people consistently had a higher rate of years of life lost due to premature excess deaths compared to the total population and compared to White and Asian people, between 2020 and 2022. AIAN communities had the highest rates compared to other racial and ethnic groups throughout the pandemic, followed by NHOPI, Black, and Hispanic people.",
            "Reporting of excess deaths aggregated for all people may hide any disparities that exist by racial and ethnic groups. There are likely numerous factors contributing to these large racial/ethnic disparities in years of life lost during the pandemic. During the pandemic, younger people of color may have been more likely to be exposed to the virus as they are more likely to have employment and living conditions thatincrease riskof exposures. Additionally, some groups of color havehigher ratesof underlying conditions that may have increased the risk of severe illness and death if people contracted the virus. Disparities in COVID-19vaccinationmay have had varying effects throughout the course of the pandemic. Though there were large gaps in vaccination rates between Black and Hispanic people and White people in the initial phases of vaccine rollout, those rates did not adjust for age and the differences narrowed and eventually reversed for Hispanic people.",
            "People of color also face broaddisparitiesin access to health care as well as in social and economic factors that drive health, which may contribute to disparities in years of life lost due to premature death during the pandemic. For example, nonelderly AIAN, Hispanic, and Black people are more likely than their White counterparts to be uninsured and many groups of color fare worse than White people across other measures of access to, use of, and quality of care, including not having a regular doctor or health care provider and going without care due to cost. Many groups of color also fare worse than White people across social and economic measures that drive health. For example, Black, Hispanic, AIAN, and NHOPI people are more likely than their White counterparts to have incomes below poverty, have lower rates of home ownership, and to live in crowded housing arrangements.",
            "Although most excess deaths during the pandemic were caused by or related to COVID-19, other factors not necessarily directly related to COVID-19 explain some excess deaths during the pandemic. For example, while drug overdose death rates increased across all racial and ethnic groups during the pandemic, theincreaseswere larger for people of color compared to White people.",
            "People of color have borne a disproportionate loss of life during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among younger ages. The finding that people of color experienced higher rates of years of life lost from excess deaths during the pandemic has significant implications for the health and economic well-being of those family members leftbehind. Higher rates of premature deaths in some groups will likely lead to long-lasting and generational impacts and may contribute to widening health and economic inequities moving forward.",
            "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)dataon excess deaths associated with COVID-19 were used to calculate excess deaths between March 28, 2020, and December 31, 2022. For each year, from 2015 to 2022, we calculate the premature mortality rate as the number of deaths under age 75, divided by the 2019 Census population under age 75, for each race/ethnicity group.",
            "Excess deaths were calculated as the observed count of deaths beyond the average number of deaths in 2015-2019. CDC excess deathdataby age groups, race or ethnicity, and week were used to assess deaths within race or ethnicity groups. These excess death counts were used to calculate years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. CDC excess death data by age groups, race or ethnicity, and week include data who identify as an “Other” racial or ethnic group. The “Other” group was excluded as they were not included as category inOMB standards. We examined excess deaths along broad racial/ethnic lines, but there may be variations within these groupings. For example, even as Asian people may have experienced lower rates of years of life lost as a broad group when comparing to other groups, these findings may mask differences amongsubgroupsof the population.",
            "For excess years of life lost calculation, excess death counts were multiplied by the distance between the mid-point of the age groups to the age standard of 75 and summed within each age and race or ethnicity group. Age 75 was chosen as most racial and ethnic groups had life expectancies above this age prior to the pandemic. Additionally, it is similar to the OECD Health Statisticsmethodologyfor calculating potential years of life lost. Setting a standard age across racial and ethnic groups allows for the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on life expectancy to not bias this analysis.",
            "Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race but are categorized as Hispanic for this analysis; all other groups are non-Hispanic. CDCdataon population counts by age and race or ethnicity were used to find years of life lost rates per 100,000 people.",

            "While those who are older have been at the higher risk of becoming seriously ill due to COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 has also affected mortality rates among younger people.",
            "In this brief, we examine changes in excess mortality and prematurity of those deaths in the U.S. and peer countries for 2020 and 2021. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) weekly excess deaths data and the World Health Organization (WHO) all-cause excess death data, we compare excess mortality in the U.S. and other large and wealthy countries through 2021 (the latest period these modelled estimates were available). We also estimate the years of life lost, a measure of the prematurity of those excess deaths, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess deaths are the number of deaths beyond what would have been expected in a typical year and can be due directly or indirectly to COVID-19, as well as other causes.",
            "We find that between March 2020 and the end of 2022, the U.S. experienced nearly 1.7 million excess deaths. When compared to other countries for the period 2020-2021—the most recent data available for all these countries—and adjusted for population size, the U.S. had the highest excess mortality rate among similarly large and wealthy countries. In addition to experiencing more excess deaths overall, the U.S. also saw a higher rate of death among younger people, and thus a larger increase in premature deaths per capita than peer countries. We also find that the per capita rate of years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. was over twice that of the U.K., the country with the next highest rate.",
            "Excess deaths are defined as the difference between the observed number of deaths in specific periods and the expected number of deaths based on historical data. Using CDC data, the chart above shows the total number of deaths from all-causes between late March 2020 through the end of December 2022 and the number of deaths that exceed the average number of deaths between 2015 and 2019.",
            "Although excess deaths can be due to any cause, it is clear that COVID-19 was directly or indirectly responsible for most of these deaths, as peaks in excess mortality correspond to peaks in COVID-19 waves. The highest number of excess deaths in one week occurred the week of January 2, 2021, a few months before COVID-19 vaccines were widely available. Since that peak, other notable points include the week of September 11, 2021, during the height of the Delta variant surge, and the week of January 22, 2022, during the peak of the Omicron variant wave.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "In the chart above, we look at WHO’s data on all-cause excess mortality rates per capita during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 and 2021) across the U.S. and peer nations. These WHO estimates are lagged and the latest data are only available through December 2021. We compared per capita excess mortality for the U.S. and other similarly large, wealthy OECD countries.",
            "In the U.S., the excess mortality rate was similar in 2020 and 2021 with 141 excess deaths per 100,000 people and 142 excess deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. In 2020, Belgium had a higher excess mortality rate than the U.S. with 148 excess deaths per 100,000 people. In 2021, Germany had a higher excess mortality rate than the U.S. with 154 excess deaths per 100,000 people.",
            "Examining both years together, the U.S. had the highest excess mortality rate among peer nations with 283 excess deaths per 100,000 people. This rate is 21% and 27% higher than Germany and the U.K., respectively, the countries with the next two highest excess mortality rates.",
            "Australia and Japan experienced lower mortality rates across the two years than would have been predicted based on prior years’ average deaths. Excess mortality rate was lower than expected by 56 per 100,000 people and 16 per 100,000 people between 2020 and 2021 in Australia and Japan, respectively.",
            "Using the WHO data on all-cause excess mortality by age groups, we calculated the years of life lost in the U.S. and other large and wealthy countries up to the age of 75 for 2020 and 2021. While some excess deaths over the age of 75 also likely occurred at ages younger than the person otherwise would have died or younger than a given country’s life expectancy, we used age 75 for all countries based on the OECD Health Statisticsmethodology. We estimate the number of years of life lost by subtracting the midpoint of the age band in which the death occurred from age 75. The total number of years of life lost is the sum of the number of deaths in a given age band times the average number of years of life lost for each age band. To calculate the per capita rate, we divide the total number of years of life lost by the population under age 75 in each country. Age bands with negative excess deaths were counted as 0 in this analysis.",
            "We find the U.S. had the highest per capita rate of years of life lost among similarly large and wealthy countries in 2020 and 2021 combined. The per capita rate of years of life lost per in the U.S. was over twice the rate in the U.K., the country with the next highest rate.",
            "This is largely driven by the higher mortality rate among younger people in the U.S. Among excess deaths that occurred before age 50, the U.S. had the highest rate among peer countries. The next highest rate was in Canada, with about half as many years of life lost per capita among those under the age of 50 years.",
            "After life expectancy at birth in the U.S. and peer countries generally increased from 1980-2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a decline in most countries in 2020. From 2020 to 2021, life expectancy at birth began to rebound in most comparable countries while it continued to decline in the U.S.",
            "The increasing gap in life expectancy at birth between the U.S. and comparable countries reflects higher mortality and premature mortality in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to peer countries, especially among people under the age of 50. As life expectancy data presented here are period life expectancy estimates based on age-specific excess mortality observed in each year, increases in mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially large increases in mortality among young people, result in decreases in life expectancy at birth.",
            "Not only did the U.S. experience more deaths per capita during the pandemic, those who died in the U.S. also died at younger ages than in similarly large and wealthy countries. Our analysis of years of life lost during the pandemic indicates the gap in premature deaths between the U.S. and peer countries has likely increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This increasing gap in premature deaths is also seen in an increasing gap inlife expectancybetween the U.S. and peer countries.",
            "Most Americans could have been vaccinated by early June 2021 in the U.S. Through early 2022, over 234,000 COVID-19deathscould have been averted with timely vaccinations. The U.S. continues to have the lowest COVID-19 vaccinationrateamong peer countries.",
            "The higher excess mortality rate among younger people in the U.S. is likely in part due to higher COVID-19 healthrisk factor ratesamong younger people in the U.S. and may also reflect differences in public health resources across the countries. Additionally,younger people of color in the U.S.suffered disproportionately during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority ofexcess deathsin both 2020 and 2021 are directly attributable to COVID-19, and many of those excess deaths that are not attributed to COVID-19 may be undiagnosed COVID-19 deaths or deaths indirectly caused by COVID-19, particularly early in the pandemic when widespread testing was not available. However, increases indrugoverdose,suicide, andfirearmdeaths in the U.S. may also be contributing factors to the U.S.’s high premature excess death rates in 2020 and 2021.",
            "The WHO global excess deaths associated with COVID-19datawere used to calculate the excess deaths through 2021 in both the U.S. and peer countries. Peer countries were selected among OECD member nations having both above median GDP and above median GDP per capita. The WHO provides estimates of excess deaths associated with COVID-19. For the country comparison, years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic were calculated by summing the number of excess deaths within each age group. Negative excess deaths within a specific age group were included as 0 in this analysis. Age groups were broken at ages 24, 39, 49, 59, and 69 years. Next, those counts were multiplied by the number of years from the mid-point of the age range up to 75 years. Although averagelife expectancyamong some peer countries is higher, we used 75 years based on the existing OECD methodology. Remaining years were calculated from ages 12, 32, 45, 55, and 65 years to the age limit for age groups 0-24, 25-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69, respectively. The decision to use these points to calculate years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic may make the gap between the U.S. and peer countries different as the age at excess death might be larger than the midpoint. For each country, 2020 OECD population counts by age groups were used to estimate measures per 100,000 people.",
            "Using OECD methodology for age group cut points, younger people were considered those from ages 0-59 years, and older people were considered those above age 60 for excess mortality and ages 60-69 for years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "A limitation of this analysis is that years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic were based on excess deaths by age groups rather than excess deaths at each age. Our results of years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic are similar to otherearlier studiesof years of life lost in the U.S. due to COVID-19. Our estimates of years of life lost are likely underestimated due to a few reasons. First, although we limited the years of life lost calculation up to an age limit of 75, excess deaths due to COVID-19 above 75 years are also premature deaths by some amount of time; therefore, estimates presented here are likely underestimated for the overall years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we incorporated excess life years saved among the youngest ages 0-24 years in the overall estimate of excess mortality (but not years of life lost during the COVID-19 pandemic). Deaths among children ages 0-14 decreased in both 2020 and 2021 in most countries.Reportsindicate deaths due to accidents and influenza have been lower among children due to social distancing and lockdown measures implemented during the pandemic. Any count of excess deaths that was less than 0 was not included in calculations of the rate of years of life lost.",

            "The high and growingcostof emergency department visits is important to consumers and policymakers alike, with recent policy changes including theNo Surprises Actaiming to curb emergency department costs. A recentKFF analysisfound that average out-of-pocket costs for an emergency visit exceed some household’sliquid assets, putting them at risk for medical debt from a single trip to the emergency department.",
            "The cost of an emergency department visit usually includes a facility fee, or overhead charge, in addition to professional charges by physicians or advanced practice providers. For a given patient, a facility fee is a charge forbeing seenat an emergency department, and it comes in addition to the costs for specific services the patient receives. Regardless of other services provided, which are billed separately, the facility fee can be thought of as the cost forwalking in the door. For emergency departments, facility fees help ensure a revenue stream to stay open and be able to providemandatedservices to the public 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. For example, facility fees can cover the cost of nursing staff, maintenance of diagnostic and therapeutic technology, building costs, and administrative overhead costs. However, these charges arevariableand usually not made publiclyavailable.",
            "To examine the role of facility fees in rising emergency department costs, we use data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, which captures claims from privately insured individuals with large employer health plans. We compare growth in facility fees to growth in professional fees for evaluation and management services delivered in emergency departments from 2004-2021, including how facility fees are billed and what they cost.",
            "We find that, on average, from 2004 to 2021, facility fees grew at a rate (531%) that was 4 times the rate of growth in professional fees (132%) for emergency department evaluation and management services. While facility fees are being billed at higher complexity over time, we find that the average cost of facility fees at all levels is rising faster than the cost of professional fees. The rapid overall growth in emergency department evaluation and management costs (relative to other outpatient settings including urgent care and physician offices) appears to be driven primarily by rapidly rising facility fees.",
            "After an emergency department visit, both the physician (or other advanced practice provider) and the facility separately bill for services provided during the visit. Both use a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) “evaluation and management” code. Evaluation and management claims are charges for the overall service provided and do not relate to specific procedures, tests, or treatments.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "While professional fees are dictated by nationally standardizedcriteria, facility fees do not have comparable standardized criteria. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers Medicare, instructs individual hospitals to create internal guidelines that “reasonably relate the intensity of hospital resources to the different levels of effort represented by the codes.” Private insurers have their ownguidelinesandprocessesfor determining if facility fees are appropriately billed.",
            "Evaluation and management charges represent nearly half of emergency department visitspending. The other half of emergency department spending is for itemized services, such as radiology or laboratory charges. These itemized additional services are similarly divided into other professional bills or facility bills for specific services rendered.",
            "In this analysis, we focus on the professional and facility fees associated with evaluation and management services, and do not include other professional and facility bills associated with itemized additional services. Although these itemized additional services represent a significant share of overall emergency department spending, they depend on the needs of a given patient, and some patients receive few or none of these additional services.",
            "Meanwhile, all patients coming to the emergency department have evaluation and management charges, including professional fees and facility fees. Focusing on the cost of these evaluation and management fees also allows us to compare growth in emergency department costs to similar services in other outpatient settings (physician offices and urgent care centers).",
            "We look at the average cost of an evaluation and management claim in the emergency department by professional versus facility fee. Emergency visits generally have at least one facility fee and at least one professional fee. A previousKFF analysisfound that the average emergency department visit cost $2,453, about half of which ($1,134) is for evaluation and management (including professional and facility fees).",
            "In the emergency department, we find the average facility fee claim is both more expensive and rising at a faster rate than professional fee claims for evaluation and management services. Emergency department professional fees increased from $138 in 2004 to $321 by 2021, growing 132% during this time. Meanwhile, the average cost of evaluation and management claims in other outpatient settings grew much more slowly, increasing 78% in physician offices and 65% in urgent care centers during this time period. Facility fees are very uncommon in other outpatient settings, so we do not break out evaluation and management into professional and facility claims for physician offices or urgent care centers.",
            "While emergency department professional fees grew at a faster rate than both physician office and urgent care evaluation and management fees, they were far outpaced by facility fee growth. Emergency department facility fees increased 531% from 2004 to 2021 (from $113 in 2004 to $713 in 2021) and 112% in the past decade (from $337 in 2012 to $713 in 2021). Facility and professional fees were comparable in 2004, but by 2021 the average facility evaluation and management claim was more than twice as expensive as the average professional evaluation and management claim.",
            "As in other outpatient settings, emergency evaluation and management claims are billed at five complexity levels usingCPTcodes 99281-99285, depending on visit complexity. Professional evaluation and management fees in the emergency department are assigned a complexity level based onguidelinesfrom the AMA, which were historically based on a review of the physician’s history, physical exam, and medical decision making. In2023, this process now only takes into account medical decision making in the emergency department.",
            "Facility fees are coded as level 1-5 based on the resources required to care for the patient, but unlike professional fees, there is not a nationally accepted standard for assigning levels. While visits result in both a professional fee and a facility fee, the level of each claim are not required to match and oftendiffer.",
            "In a separateanalysis, we show how coding for emergency evaluation and management claims have increased in complexity over time. Here, we further divide these evaluation and management charges into facility and professional fees and find that this trend toward higher complexity billing can be seen for both professional and facility fees, though the trend is more pronounced for professional fees.",
            "From 2004 to 2021, the share of level 5 facility fee claims increased from 5% to 20%, while the share of level 4 claims almost doubled from 18% to 35%. On the professional side, level 5 claims increased from 10% to 34% of all claims. Meanwhile, moderate level 3 claims went from nearly half (48%) to a quarter (25%) of all claims.",
            "From 2004-2021, the cost of facility fees at each level has increased faster than professional fees at any level, and higher complexity level facility fees have grown the fastest. Level 5 facility fees increased over 9 times the rate of growth for professional fees during this time (from $100 on average in 2004 to $930 on average in 2021), while level 1 facility fees nearly tripled from $88 to $257, on average. Meanwhile, level 5 professional fees doubled from $218, on average, in 2004 to $454, on average, in 2021. Level 1 professional fees had the most modest growth, increasing 55% from $49, on average, to $76, on average.",
            "On average, facility fees increase in cost by level. However, within each level, there is a wide range in claim costs. For example in 2021, while level 5 facility fees were, on average, $102 more expensive than level 4 facility fees, the top quarter of level 5 fees was more than twice as expensive as the bottom quarter ($1,352 versus $576). There is substantial overlap between the costs of facility fees at all levels.",
            "In this analysis, we find that the average cost of emergency evaluation and management services is increasing faster than in other outpatient settings. The disproportionately fast rate of growth in emergency department claims relative to other outpatient settings is primarily due to high and rising facility fees, as opposed to professional fees.",
            "We also find significant variation in facility fee costs, with fees for the most complex visits costing almost four times the average cost of fees for the least complex visits in 2021. Even within the same level, fees ranged widely, showing that facility fees are avariableandunpredictablecomponent of emergency department bills that may impact out-of-pocket costs for consumers with deductibles or coinsurance for emergency visits.",
            "Emergency facility fees are increasingly billed at higher levels over time, which contributes to their rising average cost. However, we find comparable trends in professional fees, so this trend alone does not explain the rising cost of facility fees relative to professional fees. We also find that at all levels of visit complexity, the cost of facility fees is increasing faster than professional fees.",
            "The rapid growth in emergency department costs may reflect a variety of factors, including increasing intensity ofservicesrequired to care for patients in the emergency setting, the growingscopeof emergency medicine, and higher costs of moreexpensivetechnology. However, we find that facility fees are rising out-of-proportion to other costs, including the cost of emergency physician services, suggesting that service intensity is not the only contributor. Increasing providerconsolidationand market power may be contributing to increasing prices of facility fees, as seen across a variety ofhealthcaresettings.",
            "Facility fees provide overheadrevenuefor hospitals to meet regulatory standards, including federal requirements for emergency departments to remain open24/7and provide necessarytriage and stabilizationtoallcomers regardless of ability to pay.Somestatesrequire emergency departments to notify patients that they will be charged a facility fee. However, even in light of recentprice transparencyregulation, onlya thirdof hospitals currently report facility fee prices. Lack ofstandardizationandtransparencycreates opportunities for consumers to be hit withsurprisinglyhigh emergency bills that may be difficult to negotiate and contribute to increasinglyunaffordableemergency care.",
            "This analysis is based on data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, which contains claims information provided by a sample of large employer plans. This analysis used claims from about 17% of the 85 million people in large group market plans (employers with a thousand or more workers) from 2004-2021. To make MarketScan data representative of large group plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Cost is the sum of the amount paid by the insurer and the amount paid by the enrollee for each claim. Claims were included if they were below the 99.5thpercentile of all claim cost. The MarketScan database includes only claims covered by the enrollees’ plan and does not include any balance billing directly from providers to enrollees.",
            "Evaluation and management claims were included and classified by location if their place of service was in the emergency department, physician office, or urgent care. We included claims that were classified as both professional and facility charges, if they were associated with evaluation and management procedure codes. Evaluation and management claims in the emergency department included CPT codes 99281-99285, which are specific to the emergency department. In offices and urgent care centers, we included 99211-99215 CPT codes for established patient visits and 99201-99205 CPT codes for new patient visits.",
            "This analysis has some limitations. First, we calculated the total cost per evaluation and management claim, though evaluation and management is often only one component of a visit. Visits in any outpatient setting may include other charges, including medications, laboratory studies, or imaging, so evaluation and management claims do not reflect the total cost of an outpatient visit. Secondly, the IBM MarketScan database includes only claims incurred under the enrollees’ plan and do not include balance billing to enrollees which may have occurred during the study period. Lastly, we include only privately insured, non-elderly adults, so these trends may not be representative of emergency department costs for other populations.",

            "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires most private health plans to cover in-network preventive services at $0 cost-sharing for enrollees.Preventive servicescovered without cost-sharing include screening tests and assessments, immunizations, behavioral counseling, contraceptives, and medications that can prevent the development or worsening of diseases and health conditions.",
            "Private health plans are required to cover preventive services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) with an “A” or a “B” rating, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), or the HRSA-sponsored Women’s Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI). These requirements apply to fully insured and self-insured health plans in the individual, small group, and fully and self-insured large group markets, except those that maintain“grandfathered”status.",
            "This preventive services mandate is currently being challenged in federal court inBraidwood Management v. Becerra. On September 7, 2022, the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas held that the ACA’s delegation to USPSTF is unconstitutional and the requirement to cover pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV violates the plaintiffs’ religious rights. The Court did not issue a remedy for the ruling, and as such, the preventive services coverage requirement remains in effect. The final briefs about the remedy were submitted to the court at the end of January 2023, and a decision is expected soon. While we know the district court will issue a remedy regarding the services recommended by USPSTF, it is not yet clear how broadly the ruling will apply. The parties will likely appeal, and it is expected that the plaintiffs will continue to challenge all the ACA’s required preventive services recommended by USPSTF, as well as HRSA and ACIP.",
            "This analysis looks at the share of privately insured people who received ACA preventive care (service or medication). We use two claims databases to assess utilization of preventive care: Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters dataset for large group enrollees and the Enrollee-Level External Data Gathering Environment (EDGE) Limited Data Set (LDS) for individual and small group market enrollees. As some preventive care is only recommended for people of a certain age, sex, or with a given diagnosis, we limit the analysis to services and prescriptions meeting these criteria, using definitions of preventive care from a large insurer.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Because the preventive care criteria we obtained for this analysis are from 2018, we merged these criteria onto 2018 claims data. As we discuss more below,preventive services utilizationchanged during the pandemic, as many people delayed or went without routine screenings in 2020 and most adults received COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. By late 2022, uptake of updated COVID-19 boosters was low and concentrated among older adults, who are disproportionately on Medicare and more likely to receive other (non-COVID) preventive care, too. Though much has changed since 2018 and the outlook of the pandemic is difficult to predict, we think our use of pre-pandemic data to assess the share of privately enrolled adults accessing any preventive care is more reflective of preventive care utilization in a typical year than more recent years of data would be. To the extent some privately insured people who otherwise receive no preventive care do get COVID-19 vaccines (including boosters) under the preventive services requirement, our estimates are conservative.",
            "We find that 6 in 10 privately insured people (60%) received some ACA preventive care in 2018. Women, children, and older adults were more likely to have received preventive care. According to the American Community Survey, 173 million non-elderly people have private health insurance coverage. Based on this, we estimate roughly 100 million privately insured people got preventive care required under the ACA in 2018.",
            "Similar shares of people who get their coverage through a large employer (61%), fully insured small employer (57%), and the individual market (those purchasing health coverage directly through ACA Exchanges or health plan websites) (55%) got preventive care.",
            "The most commonly received preventive care includes vaccinations (not including COVID-19 vaccines), well woman and well child visits, and screenings for heart disease, cervical cancer, diabetes, and breast cancer. Some of these common preventive services are recommended by the USPSTF, while others are recommended by ACIP or HRSA.",
            "Many ACA preventive services are recommended only for specific groups of people, such as based on age or gender. For example, mammograms are recommended for women ages 50 to 74, while many vaccinations are recommended to young children. In this analysis, we look at the share of people receiving preventive care and do not limit the analysis only to those eligible for a service.",
            "We find that about 7 in 10 children (ages 0-17) with private insurance accessed preventive care in 2018, with similar shares across boys and girls. A similar share, about 7 in 10, young women with private coverage use preventive care into adulthood, while young men use preventive care at far lower rates (about 3 in 10). In middle age, utilization of preventive care increases for men, but still at lower rates than for women. Again, this could be influenced by which preventive services are recommended for certain groups.",
            "In this analysis, we find about 6 in 10 privately insured people, or roughly 100 million people, received ACA preventive care in 2018. Some of these preventive services were recommended by the USPSTF, while others were recommended by other government bodies. Our findings suggest the outcome of theBraidwood Management v. Becerracase could have widespread implications for out-of-pocket costs and access to preventive care.",
            "Currently, the preventive services coverage requirement remains in effect. It is not yet clear how broadly the district court’s remedy for the services recommended by USPSTF will apply, or what higher courts will decide on appeal. If the case makes its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, the implications of a final decision in favor of the plaintiffs would depend on the breadth and basis of that ruling.",
            "Overturning any part of the ACA’s preventive services coverage requirement would leave coverage decisions to health plans. If not for the ACA’s preventive services coverage mandate, health plans would have discretion to apply cost-sharing for these services, which could include copayments, coinsurance, or deductibles. The cost of preventive services varies widely depending on the service. For example, the price of a flu shot might be roughly$50, while the price of a colonoscopy is often well over$1,000. Out-of-pocket costs could cause some tomiss or delaycare. Missed or delayed screenings could lead to later diagnoses of health conditions that might have been more treatable or less costly if caught earlier. If health plans shift out-of-pocket costs toward preventive care, though, that could result in other services having lower out-of-pocket costs or some health plans having slightly lower premiums.",
            "This analysis reflects preventive care utilization in 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, severalstudiesdocumented a sharpdecreasein use of routine care, includingcancer screenings, as many people delayed or went without care due toconcerns about COVID-19Although use of healthcare generally hasreboundedsince the early pandemic, a substantial share of adults continued to report delaying or missing care due to the pandemic in 2021. Meanwhile, though, in 2021, most adults in the U.S. received COVID-19 vaccines, which qualify as ACA preventive care. (To date, all doses were purchased by the federal government and providers were prohibited from charging patients, regardless of their insurance status. However, providers could seek reimbursement for administration or visit costs from insurers, and largely because of the ACA’s preventive service requirements, private insurers were generally required to reimburse providers.)",
            "Going forward, we might expect a return to pre-pandemic levels of preventive care utilization shown in this analysis. COVID-19 boosters and other new additions to the preventive services recommendations could have a small upward effect on the share of people receiving preventive care. However, uptake of the updated bivalent booster was low and concentrated among older adults, who are disproportionately covered by Medicare. Additionally, older adults enrolled in private coverage are more likely to receive other preventive care (e.g., flu vaccines and cancer screenings), in which case their receipt of a COVID booster may not meaningfully increase the share of people receiving an ACA preventive service. It is therefore unclear whether future COVID-19 boosters would meaningfully increase the share of privately insured people receiving preventive care, but to the extent they do have an upward effect, our estimates are conservative.",

            "We used two claims databases as the foundation of this analysis. For large group employer health plans, 2018 Merative MarketScan claims data were used. To make MarketScan data representative of large group health plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age, state, and whether the enrollee was a policy holder or dependent. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range. For the individual and small employer group markets, Enrollee-Level External Data Gathering Environment (EDGE) Limited Data Set for 2018 was used. The 2018 EDGE data include masked enrollment and claims information for nearly 30 million enrollees in ACA-compliant individual and small employer group plans in all states and the District of Columbia. Enrollees 65 and older and enrollees with enrollment of 6 months or less were excluded from both MarketScan and EDGE data. The EDGE data do not include enrollees in grandfathered, association, or short-term plans, who may have different utilization patterns.",
            "Preventive services were flagged in the MarketScan outpatient and EDGE medical files based on CPT/HCPCS codes, age/sex criteria, and if required, presence of a relevant diagnosis in the year. Preventive drugs were flagged in MarketScan and EDGE pharmacy claims files based on NDC codes, age/sex criteria, and if required, certain diagnosis codes in the year.",
            "We were able to codify the criteria for preventive services from a large insurer in 2018 and apply those criteria to our EDGE and MarketScan claims databases. The algorithm to flag preventive services and drugs was developed based on a scan of preventive care recommended in 2018 andCigna’s criteria. Enrollees with at least one preventive service flag were identified at the “enrolid”-level in MarketScan or “sysid”-level in EDGE.",
            "For claims flagged based on preventive care recommendation groups and based on review of one insurer’s definition of preventive services, there are some claims we identify as ACA preventive services that still show cost-sharing. There is room for interpretation of the preventive services recommendations (e.g., frequency of screenings, prior authorization) so some insurers likely apply different guidelines. The inverse could also be true, and we may have missed some preventive services that other insurance plans do fully cover at no cost sharing. Even if we had every insurers’ definition of preventive care, we would not be able to match that definition to enrollees in the claims data because the datasets do not include the health plan name or plan design information.",

            "The cost of an outpatient visit to a physician’s office, urgent care center, or emergency department depends in part on the level of service provided. Providers and facilities generally charge higher prices for more complex visits, and insurers pay larger reimbursements. Patients with deductibles or co-insurance may havehigher out-of-pocket costsfor more complex visits, too. Although there are standardizedguidelinesfor how to determine the complexity of a visit, there is a trend towards visits being billed at higher levels over time. This could reflect increases in actual acuity and the intensity of services required, or changes in billing practices, or both. There is concern that providers may be inappropriately billing for more complex—and thus more expensive—services, a practice known as “upcoding.”",
            "In this analysis, we review the literature on coding practices, and using claims data we examine trends in complexity coding across outpatient practice settings from 2004 to 2021. We look at private, large employer-based insurance claims from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters database for non-elderly people. We examine the distribution of code levels in physician offices, urgent care centers, and emergency departments over time, for all evaluation and management claims and for specific diagnoses. This analysis only includes evaluation and management claims and does not include additional visit-associated bills such as laboratory tests or other services.",
            "Over the 18-year period of our analysis, we find that claims across all three sites of care trended towards higher level codes, even among specific, common diagnoses like urinary tract infections and headaches. The average age of this population stayed consistent over time. However, we do not assess whether health status worsened with time, so we are not able to assess whether increases in billed complexity represent actual changes in clinical characteristics. These trends could therefore be explained by multiple factors beyond upcoding, such as increasing clinical acuity, changes in services provided, or care for some diseases shifting from the inpatient to the outpatient setting.",
            "These changes are contributing to higher outpatient health spending. We find that in 2021, outpatient evaluation and management spending was 4% higher in both physician offices and emergency departments than it would have been if visits were coded at the same levels as in 2011.",
            "Visit complexity is determined by the level of evaluation and management services billed by the provider or hospital. Evaluation and management services are billed using American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, and AMA guidelines for assigning these codes are approved by theCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Level 1 visits are the lowest complexity cases, with less time required or straightforward medical decision making, while level 5 visits are the highest complexity cases, with more time required or very complex medical decision making. Payers generally reimburse a higher rate for more complex cases to reflect the increased resources and time required to treat these cases.",

            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Several prior studies have shown that outpatient costs are increasing and that providers are billing for more complex services. AKFF analysisof U.S. healthcare price growth found that the average price of an outpatient office visit grew faster than inflation from 2003-2019, and that the share of level 4 visits increased from less than 1-in-5 (19%) to more than 1-in-3 (36%) during the same period. Similar trends have been documented in theemergency departmentandinpatienthospital setting. While the reasons behind increasing visit complexity are likely multifactorial, these trends have raisedconcernswhether some providers might be “upcoding,” or inflating medical complexity to receive higher payments.",
            "Some of this trend toward more complex coding may be explained by an aging and more medically complex population requiring more outpatient services. In the emergency department, there is some correlation between number of services provided and complexity billed, but this relationship does notcompletelyexplainthe increases in complexity levels billed. One study found that of all physicians who provided outpatient, inpatient, or other evaluation and management services for Medicare beneficiaries in 2010, physicians who consistently bill at the highest complexity levels treat patients who aresimilarin age and diagnoses to their counterparts.",
            "Regardless of the reason behind it, the trend toward billing for higher complexity services appears to have led to increased spending on outpatient services. The Center for Public Integrity found that higher codes for routine office visits led to a$6.6 billionincrease in Medicare payments from 2001-2010, and that higher codes in the emergency department increased costs by$1 billionfrom 2001-2008.",
            "In this analysis, we find a trend toward higher level claims in physician offices, urgent care centers and emergency departments, though this trend is most pronounced in emergency departments. Taking claims from all three settings, we find that the share of moderate intensity (level 3) claims decreased from the majority (60%) of claims in 2004 to less than half (45%) in 2021. Meanwhile, higher intensity level 4 claims almost doubled in frequency, from 19% in 2004 to 37% in 2021. The shares of claims at each level remained relatively stable during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Levels 3 and 4 claims continued to be the most common during this time; however level 5 claims continued to increase in frequency to 6% in 2021. During the pandemic, level 1 and 2 claims also increased to 4% and 7% respectively by 2021.",
            "In the emergency department, the most common claim in 2004 was level 3. However, by 2021, level 4 was the most common and accounted for over one third (35%) of claims. Level 5 claims increased in frequency from 8% of emergency department claims in 2004 to a quarter of claims by 2021. Thegrowingnumber ofurgent carecenters in the past two decades may contribute to increased acuity in emergency departments by siphoning less sick patients away from emergency departments. However, we also find that visit complexity is rising outside of the emergency department.",
            "In outpatient physician offices, the share of higher level claims also grew over time. Level 3 claims remained the most common from 2004 to 2021, but the share of level 3 claims reduced from 61% in 2004 to 48% in 2021. In 2004, level 4 claims accounted for 1-in-5 outpatient office claims, which increased to over one third of claims in 2021 (38%). Across the period of our study, outpatient physician offices had a relatively low proportion of the lowest level (level 1) and the highest level (level 5) claims.",
            "In urgent care centers, level 3 and 4 claims accounted for 76% of claims in 2004 and reached 93% of claims by 2019, before down trending during the pandemic years. Level 4 claims grew from less than a quarter (21%) of all urgent care claims in 2004 to almost half (49%) before the pandemic. The share of lower complexity claims decreased during this time. In 2004, almost a quarter of claims (23%) were level 1 or level 2. By 2019, level 2 claims made up 5% and level 1 claims made up 0% of all claims in urgent care centers. During 2020 and 2021, we observed a growth in level 1-3 claims at urgent care centers, and a decrease in level 4 claims. These changes may represent shifting health care utilization during the pandemic, changes in billing practices, or a combination of multiple factors.",
            "Over time more people in the U.S. have been diagnosed withcomorbidconditions, which may make patients more complex or resource intensive to treat and may contribute to the increasing complexity of outpatient claims. However, we find that trends in coding levels are reflected even in diseases that are less likely to be worsening over time or in which comorbidities have a smaller impact. We restrict our analysis to younger people (<65), who are less likely to havechronic conditions, and we also find that the average age of our population remained consistent during our analysis, suggesting that the aging population is not a contributor to the increases in billing complexity we find.",
            "For urinary tract infections, moderate complexity (level 3) claims were over half (54%) of emergency department claims and two-thirds (67%) of all outpatient office claims in 2004. By 2021, level 3 claims accounted for only 31% of emergency department claims and 57% of outpatient office claims. In the emergency department, 1-in-5 claims for urinary tract infections was level 5 in 2021.",
            "For headache, level 3 claims were the most common in 2004 in both physician offices (58%) and emergency departments (41%). By 2021, level 4 claims were the majority in both settings. In the emergency department, the share of level 5 claims more than tripled from 2004 to 2021.",
            "In 2021, the average cost of evaluation and management services was almost 5 times as expensive in the emergency department ($556) compared to outpatient physician offices ($125). Emergency department claims also have the most variation in cost by level. The average level 5 claim is over $400 more expensive than the average level 1 claim. Urgent care evaluation and management claims cost $147, on average.",
            "For each practice setting, costs of claims are growing at different rates. The emergency department saw the largest relative increase in evaluation and management costs at all levels. Level 1 claims increased in cost by 138%, and level 5 claims increased by 185% from 2004 to 2021. In offices, the cost of Level 1 visits remained relatively flat, increasing by 3%, while the cost of the highest complexity (Level 5) outpatient office claim increased by 79%. In urgent care centers, the gap between the lowest complexity and highest complexity claims also widened. The cost of level 1 claims remained flat, while the cost of level 5 claims increased by 59%.",
            "Next, we examine how much lower 2021 spending would have been if visits were billed at the same levels as 10 years earlier. To do this, we multiply the average cost of each level claim in 2021 (e.g., the average level 5 emergency visit in 2021 was $556) times the share of visits that were billed at that level in 2011 (e.g., 16% of emergency visits were billed at level 5 in 2011). We calculate hypothetical total spending on evaluation and management services for the 2021 population using 2021 costs and 2011 levels, and we compare this to the actual 2021 spending using 2021 levels.",
            "We find that if outpatient visit levels were coded the same in 2021 as they were in 2011, there would have been significant cost-savings in 2021. Both physician office and emergency department evaluation and management spending would have been 4% lower in 2021 than 2021 actual spending. Using 2004 levels instead of 2011 levels, emergency department spending would be 11% lower and office spending would be 10% lower in 2021 than actual 2021 spending. The majority of the cost saving would come from outpatient office claims because they make up a larger share of the outpatient evaluation and management spending we studied (69%) compared to emergency departments (27%) and urgent cares (3%). These numbers do not identify the portion of cost savings related to changes in services provided versus changes in billing patterns, since we did not control for clinical characteristics of the population.",
            "Over time, outpatient visits are being coded at higher levels, thus resulting in higher costs. We find that if the distribution of claim levels had stayed consistent over the prior ten years, outpatient evaluation and management costs would have been 4% lower in 2021. Of the outpatient settings we studied, emergency department evaluation and management claims are coded at the highest levels and are the most expensive, on average; however, outpatient office visits are the largest contributor to aggregate outpatient health expenditures because of the larger number of office visits.",
            "The trend toward higher levels is seen across all outpatient settings, including emergency departments, urgent care centers, and physician offices. Increasing levels of visit complexity could reflect changes in billing, services provided, patient acuity, or a combination of factors. We did not control for clinical acuity; however, we did observe a trend towards higher claim levels even for specific conditions that are less likely to be worsening over time or for which comorbidities have a smaller impact, like headaches and urinary tract infections.",
            "Overall, our findings demonstrate that regardless of the driving factors, increasing billing at higher levels for outpatient care has led to substantial increases in outpatient visit spending at the health system level. For consumers who bear the marginal costs of more expensive services—those withco-insurance or deductibles—this trend impacts out-of-pocket costs in addition to overall health system costs.",
            "This analysis is based on data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, which contains claims information provided by a sample of large employer plans. This analysis used claims for almost 14 million people representing about 17% of the 85 million people in large group market plans (employers with a thousand or more workers) from 2004-2021. To make MarketScan data representative of large group plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Claims were included if they were below the 99.5thpercentile of costs.",
            "Claims were included and classified by location if their place of service was in the emergency department, office, or urgent care. We included claims that were classified as both professional and facility charges, if they were associated with evaluation and management procedure codes. Evaluation and management claims in the emergency department included 99281-99285, which are evaluation and management CPT codes that are specific to the emergency department. Note that in2023, 99281 is no longer being used for physician encounters and these codes are now based only on complexity of medical decision-making; however these changes do not affect the time period included in our analysis. In the office, we included the outpatient established patient evaluation and management codes, which are 99211-99215, because the vast majority of visits in outpatient physician offices were for established patients. In urgent care, visits were relatively evenly divided between new and established patients, so we created an aggregate complexity level from 1-5 combining CPT codes 99211-99215 (established patients) and 99201-99205 (new patients). Primary headache, upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were defined by ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes included in each claim. Enrollees were considered to have a certain diagnosis if the relevant ICD code appeared in the “Diagnosis 1” on the claim.",
            "This analysis has some limitations. First, we analyzed only spending that happened within the specific place in our analysis (emergency department, office, or urgent care). Some visits, especially emergency department visits, have testing such as imaging or lab studies that occur outside of the emergency department in a different part of the hospital, and these are not included in our analysis. Second, the MarketScan database includes only charges incurred under the enrollees’ plan and do not include balance billing to enrollees which may have occurred during the study period.",

            "Get the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.",
            "Note: This brief was updated on March 21, 2023 to reflect new federalguidanceissued on March 17, 2023.",
            "TheNo Surprises Actprohibits most surprise bills starting in 2022. About1 in 5emergency room visits and16%of in-network hospitalizations for non-emergency care included surprise bills from out-of-network providers. The law prohibits doctors, hospitals, and other covered providers from billing patients more than the in-network cost sharing amount for protected services, which include: emergency services, post-stabilization services, non-emergency services at in-network facilities, and air ambulance services. The protections cover people with private insurance (including employer-based coverage, non-group plans, and grandfathered plans). The patient’s cost sharing amount for out-of-network services and items covered under the law is required to be no more than the in-network cost sharing.",
            "To determine the plan payment to the out-of-network provider or facility, the No Surprises Act established an independent dispute resolution (IDR) process. The IDR process takes patients out of the disputes between the out-of-network provider’s asked price and plan payment for surprise bills. Instead, a third-party baseball-style arbitration process determines the plan payment amount.",
            "In this explainer, we describe when federal or state IDR process applies, the federal IDR process timelines, recent data from federal IDR disputes, and implications for providers, payers, and patients.",
            "The federal IDR process will apply forallself-insuredgroupplans (which represent 65% of workers with employer-based coveragein2021).In states that do not have any surprise billing protections, the federal IDR process will also apply forfully-insuredplans.Astateprocesswill apply forfully-insuredplansin22 stateswhere the state has somesurprise billing protections.In21ofthose22states,thestate’slawcoversonly aportionof the federal surprise billing protections.In these“bifurcated process”states, the federal process will apply where thesurprise billis not covered under state law.Some statespermitself-funded employer plans to opt into thestate’sprocess.",
            "After the provider files a claim, the plan generally has 30 days to make an initial determination on whether and how to cover a claim. Once a claim is filed, by day 30, the health plan must decide whether it will pay, deny, or adjust the claim. There are rules permitting extensions in certain circumstances, for example, if the plan determines the claim is incomplete, the plan could ask for additional information. On the date the health plan processes the surprise bill claim, it calculates the applicable in-network cost sharing amount based on thequalified payment amount(QPA)—which is the median in-network contracted rate by the health plan issuer in the same insurance market and region for the item or service. The plan informs the out-of-network provider of the patient’s responsibility and issues an explanation of benefits (EOB) to the patient showing the applicable in-network cost sharing that the patient owes the provider.",
            "Open negotiation period must be exhausted before initiating a federal IDR process. After the plan determination, the plan or provider initiate open negotiation on the payment. Parties must exhaust 30 business days (or about 42 calendar days) of open negotiations before entering the federal IDR process. If the parties do not reach an agreement after open negotiation, either party can initiate the federal IDR process within 4 business days following the end of open negotiations.",
            "Federal independent dispute resolution entities select one of the offers submitted. Parties have 10 business days to select a certified IDR entity and submit offers of payment.IDR entitiesare third-party organizations that are certified by the federal government to arbitrate the payment amount between plans and providers.The selected IDR entity picks one of the two offers within 30 business days of offer submissions. In selecting the offer, the IDR entity considers the QPA and additional supporting materials. Additional supporting materials can include provider’s or facility’s quality, market share, and complexity of population served. The IDR entity is not allowed to consider typical provider charges or public payers’ payment rates.From IDR entity selection to the IDR entity selecting an offer can take up to about 62 calendar days. Once the IDR selects one of the offers submitted by the plan or the provider, the health plan has 30 calendar days to make any additional payments. From the claim determination to any additional payment being made can take over 6 months.",
            "Provider groups have challenged the No Surprises Act and the implementation of the law inmultiplelawsuits. A lawsuit brought by the Texas Medical Association resulted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas setting aside parts of theinitialNo Surprises Act implementing regulations, including the requirement that IDR entities presume that the QPA amount is theappropriate ratefor the claim, absentadditionalinformation. Another requirement, that the certified IDR entity select the offer closest to the QPA unlessadditionalcredible informationindicatesotherwise, was also vacated.In response to this court ruling, the Biden Administration issued afinal rulein August 2022 requiring the IDR entities to consider the QPA first and then consider other submitted justifications in addition to the QPA in selecting an offer. On February 6, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas again ruled in favor of the Texas Medical Association in another challenge to the IDR regulations andruledthe August 2022 final rule unlawfully favors the QPA. In response to this ruling, federal regulators initially asked IDR entities toholdpayment determinations. On February 24, 2023, federal regulators asked IDR entities toresumepayment determinations for disputes involving items or services furnished before October 25, 2022, and to continue holding payment determinations for those furnished on or after October 25, 2022, until further guidance. On March 17, 2023, federal regulatorspostedupdated guidance in response to the February 6, 2023 decision, and resumed IDR payment determinations for all disputes. Otherchallengesare pending and will determine the future of the No Surprises Act implementation.",
            "According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is responsible for implementing the law, 90,000 disputes were initiated through the federal IDR process from April to September of 2022. Disputes initiated in this period exceeded CMS’ initialestimateof less than 20,000 for the entire year. Similar disputes between the same provider and plan are required to be batched and so we do not know how many out-of-network items or services were disputed through the federal IDR process.",
            "Half of disputes submitted (46%) were challenged by the other party and 18% were found ineligible for the federal IDR process. The non-initiating party can challenge the dispute’s eligibility for the federal IDR process. The dispute can be found ineligible if state jurisdiction applies, incomplete or incorrect information is submitted, submission does not comply with requirements, or the open negotiation period has not been exhausted.",

            "The IDR process incentivizes good faith plan and provider offers. The federal IDR process is established as a last resort in case all other plan-provider negotiations fail. If the parties choose to use the federal IDR process, then the process incentivizes both parties to make reasonable offers, as one of the two offers will be selected. Unless the providers and plans can justify their offer payment amount, very high or very low offers would likely result in the other party’s offer being picked.",
            "The losing party (whose offer is not selected by the IDR) is responsible for the IDR fees. The IDR process in theory leaves room for the plan to make an initial payment to the provider that is far below the QPA, and let the process play out to benefit the plan’s own cash flow, and in-turn create cash flow issues for the provider. Offsetting that potential, though, are the baseball arbitration rules of the IDR process, which specify that the IDR must select either the plan’s or the provider’s offer, and the losing party must pay theIDR fee. The IDR fees in 2023 can range from$350 to $700for single determinations and from$475 to $938for batched determinations. This may incentivize the plans to avoid lowballing their offer amount and the providers to avoid asking for high payment rates without strong justification. Otherwise, the outlier party risks getting stuck with the other party’s offer and the IDR fee.",
            "Providers not participating in any plan networks could face longer timelines for reimbursement.The time from plan initial claim determination to IDR decision and plan payment could take over 6 months. Providers with many out-of-network claims could face cashflow issues while waiting to resolve payment disputes.",
            "Patients generally should not be affected by the IDR process, so long as the plan or provider did not make a billing mistake. The out-of-network provider is permitted to bill the patient only the applicable in-network cost sharing amount for surprise out-of-network bills, regardless of the IDR entity’s determination. Once the patient pays their cost-sharing amount, the patient has no further responsibility. If there are billing mistakes, a patient may not notice them or know how to address them.",
            "Health plans and providers can be issued penalties for not correctly covering surprise medical bills or sending incorrect bills to patients. For plans who incorrectly process claims, they can be charged up to$100per dayper affected beneficiary under federal law.Stateregulators may have additional authority and enforcement tools they can use to address billing problems. On the provider side, the penalty for incorrect billing is up to$10,000per violation. That is, if a provider sends 200 incorrect bills, the provider could be penalized $2,000,000.",
            "The No Surprises Act independent dispute resolution process generally encourages plans and providers to resolve payment disputes outside of the IDR arbitration process, while at the same time protecting patients, though early experience shows the number of arbitrated disputes has been higher than expected. The federal independent dispute resolution process has the potential to put downward pressure on prices, particularly among providers charging extremely high prices. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) hadestimateda premium decrease of between 0.5% and 1% as a result of the No Surprises Act. Thus far, health plans are generally not estimating an impact of this law on 2023premiums.",
            "With the IDR payment determination guidelines for out-of-network services being challenged in the courts, the impact of the law on premiums remains uncertain. The federal agencies’ modification to how the IDR entity selects the offer due to these lawsuits may weaken the downward cost pressures.",

            "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, many outpatient visits and elective hospitalizations were delayed, avoided, or cancelled, leading to a sharp decline in healthcareutilization. However, there have beenexpectationsthat there will be pent-up demand for this missed care.",
            "In this chart collection, using a variety of data sources, we look at the latest available data on how health services utilization has changed over the course of the pandemic. We find that, as of mid-to-late 2022, utilization of healthcare is generally rebounding, but some of that use is likely for COVID-related treatment, testing, or vaccination, making it difficult to assess how non-COVID care compares to the amount of care people received pre-pandemic. It is likely that utilization of some services, particularly for non-COVID care, remains below expectations based on pre-pandemic trends.",
            "There was asharp dropin utilization in 2020, particularly during the earliest months of the pandemic. Even in 2021, as vaccines became available, about one in five people ages 18 years and older (21%) reported delaying or foregoing medical care due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "This chart and other charts below that use NHIS data are based on survey questions that specify missed or delayed “medical care.”There are other NHIS questions about missed or delayed prescriptions and metal health care due to costs, but the survey does not ask whether the pandemic was a reason for these delays, so we limit our analysis here to missed or delayed medical care. Additionally, NHIS sometimes asks about missed or delayed dental care due to cost, but the survey did not include this question in 2021.",
            "In 2021, one in four adults (26%) missed or delayed medical care due to either the COVID-19 pandemic or healthcare costs.",
            "We find that 4% of adults in the U.S. missed or delayed medical care due tobothcosts and the pandemic in 2021. Meanwhile, 17% of adults reported missing or delaying care due to thepandemicbut not costs, and 5% reported missing or delaying medical care due tocostsbut not the pandemic.",
            "In addition to costs and the pandemic, there could be additional reasons for missed or delayed care, such as an inability to take time off of work, a lack of transportation, or a lack of available appointments.",
            "NHIS publishes quarterly updates to the rates ofcost-related access barriers, but similar quarterly updates are not available forpandemic-related barriers. Cost-related access barriers rose in the early pandemic, likely associated with rising unemployment and resulting income instability, as well as disruption in health coverage. The rates of reported cost barriers have since declined somewhat in recent quarters, even asinflationputs strain onhousehold budgets. The uninsured rate is currently at arecord low, and Medicaid and ACA Marketplace enrollment are atrecord highs. Medicaid generally has little to no cost-sharing, and enhanced subsidies in the ACA Marketplaces may have helped enrollees afford health plans with lower deductibles.",
            "However, there are other factors to consider. While the share of adults who reported delaying or not getting care due to cost reasons decreased from 2019 to 2021, part of this trend might be because COVID-19 presented another reason care was delayed or foregone. It is difficult to tease apart the various reasons one might not get the care they need. There is also variation across demographic groups in rates of cost-related access barriers (discussed more below). Additionally, as pandemic-era Medicaidcontinuous coverage endsand dis-enrollments resume, there will likely be an uptick in the uninsured rate, which could result in increases in cost-related barriers to care. Our earlier work has shown that many households lack theliquid assetsneeded to afford out-of-pocket expenses typical in private health plans.KFF pollinghas consistently shown the difficult decisions families make in juggling costs for essentials like housing, food, and healthcare.",
            "The number of hospital discharges in the third quarter of 2022 remained below the average quarterly discharges in prior years. Quarterly hospital discharges in 2018-2019 averaged 9.8 million. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, total discharges in a quarter peaked in the third quarter of 2021 at 9.3 million, 500,000 discharges below the pre-pandemic quarterly average in 2018-2019. Despite increases in discharges through the end of 2021, there was a drop in discharges in the first quarter of 2022 compared to both the first quarter of 2021 and the previous quarter. Total discharges in the third quarter of 2022 were 9.1 million, about 700,000 discharges below the pre-pandemic quarterly average in 2018-2019.",
            "Nevertheless, there may still be strain on hospital resources in part because theaverage length of stayis increasing. Additionally, until recently,hospital employmenthad remained below pre-pandemic levels.",
            "While COVID-19 hospital admissions have increased during this most recent winter wave of infections, the level of admissions is well short of what we saw a year ago. As the virus continues to mutate, the future course of the pandemic, and what it means for health utilization and spending, is quite uncertain.",
            "The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) early release estimates provide a look at how visits to doctor’s offices and hospital emergency departments have changed from 2019 through mid-2022. Because the survey asks about utilization in the past year, though, it may mask volatility in utilization from month to month.",
            "The share of adults with a doctor visit in the last year has recovered but has not reached early 2019 levels. In the first quarter of 2019, 85.3% of adults reported going to a doctor in the previous 12 months. The share of adults who had a doctor visit decreased in 2020 and reached the lowest level in the first quarter of 2021 with 80.1% of adults having seen a doctor in the prior year. In the most recent quarter with available data, the second quarter of 2022, 83.1% of adults saw a doctor in the past year.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Like physician care, utilization of emergency care appears to be somewhat below pre-pandemic levels, especially considering that an unknown share of current emergency care is due to COVID-19. The share of adults reporting an emergency department visit in the previous 12 months dropped from 22.2% in the first quarter of 2019 to 17.0% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The share of adults reporting a visit to an emergency department in the past year has since rebounded but remains below early 2019 levels. Emergency department visits in the past year rebounded to 19.4% in the third quarter of 2021 and were at 19.1% in the most recent quarter (second quarter of 2022).",
            "Using data private insurers report to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, it appears the number of physician encounters per person has mostly rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. These data have some limitations, though. For example, an unknown share of current visits is for COVID-related care (treatment, vaccination, and testing), so it is likely that non-COVID care is still below pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, although the data represent people enrolled across a variety of markets (including fully insured individual and group, as well as privately administered public coverage), the chart above does not include traditional Medicare without supplemental coverage, state-administered Medicaid, or self-insured employers, which combined represent a significant share of the U.S. population.",
            "Another way to look at utilization trends is to use quantity indices from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In 2021, healthcare prices increased by 2.9%, in line with previous years, but health services use increased by 7.3% relative to 2020. This increase in healthcare use in 2021 followed a sharp decrease in health utilization in 2020, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as many health services, such as elective procedures and routine care, were postponed or cancelled.",
            "While the price index for drugs grew steadily since 2010 (ranging in growth from about 0.5% to 3.9% annually), it decreased by 1.6% between 2020 and 2021, following a 0.7% increase between 2019 and 2020.  The utilization index, which has been more volatile year to year, increased 5.2% in 2020 over the previous year.",
            "Unlike health services, pharmaceutical product utilization grew in 2020 over the previous year and the 2021 annual growth rate was similar to the rate seen in recent decades. This is likely in part due to many people stockpiling needed medications early in the pandemic when lockdowns were announced. Additionally, with local delivery or mail-in pharmacies, many people were likely able to continue filling retail prescription drugs with limited interactions and risk of spreading COVID-19. Thoughnew prescriptionslikely declined with fewer doctor visits.",
            "In 2021, the cost of care and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to people delaying or foregoing care. Across all race and ethnicity groups, the COVID-19 pandemic was a more prevalent reason for delaying or foregoing care compared to cost. Asian adults had the lowest share of individuals who reported delaying care due to cost (4%), while those who were a part of an Other racial or ethnic group reported the highest share of adults who delayed or foregone care due to cost (13%).",
            "Black adults had the lowest share of people who delayed or foregone care due to COVID-19 (18%). Adults who were a part of an Other racial or ethnic group also had the highest share of individuals who delayed or foregone care due to the COVID-19 pandemic (27%).",
            "Uninsured people had the highest share of adults who had delayed or foregone care due to cost (27%) but reported the lowest share of adults who had delayed or foregone care due to the COVID-19 pandemic (15%). Among those with private insurance, over one in five (22%) had delayed or foregone care due to the pandemic, the highest across all insurance groups. Among adults enrolled in Medicare, only 4% reported having delayed or foregone care due to cost, the lowest across all insurance types.",
            "While NHIS shows about one in ten adult individuals delaying or forgoing care due to cost, KFF polling has found a larger share of adults report at least one person in their household has delayed or gone without care due to costs. Rates of forgone care are highest for uninsured and low-income individuals and households.",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on mortality in the United States, leading to life expectancy decreasing in the U.S. by far more than in other large, wealthy countries. The pandemic has also exacerbated access barriers and spotlighted the health inequities experienced by people of color. Health spending in the U.S. continues to far exceed what peer countries spend and out-of-pocket costs grew rapidly last year.",
            "In this brief, we assess the current state of the U.S. health system using dozens of data points on costs, outcomes, and quality of and access to care from the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker and the accompanyingHealth System Dashboard. We also discuss the outlook for 2023 in the context of the likely end of the public health emergency, depletion of federal COVID funds, and strain on the healthcare workforce.",
            "Since the start of the pandemic, life expectancy has dropped across all race and ethnicity groups in the U.S. However, people of color experienced a greaterdeclinein life expectancy. Since 2019, life expectancy for Black and Hispanic people has declined by 4 or more years, while life expectancy for White people has declined by 2.4 years. COVID-19 continues to contribute to excess mortality in 2022, and is on track to be thethird leading cause of deathin the U.S. for the third consecutive year.",
            "By contrast, in most similarly large and wealthy nations, life expectancy began to rebound in 2021, widening apre-existing gapbetween the U.S. and its peers. The U.S. has the lowest life expectancy compared to similarly large, wealthy peer countries, despite spending the most money per capita on healthcare.Life expectancyat birth in the U.S. was 76.1 years, compared to 82.4 years in other comparable countries, on average in 2021.",
            "Overall health spendingcontinued to growin 2021, reaching a total of nearly $4.3 trillion dollars. This amounts to 18.3% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and average of $12,914 per capita.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "The U.S. continues to have the highest health spending per capita among comparable countries. In 2021, the U.S.’s $12,914 per capita health spending was more than double the average for other comparably large and wealthy countries ($6,003). The country spending the second highest amount on health per capita was Germany, at $7,383.",
            "As of second quarter 2022, health spendingin the U.S. has rebounded since the beginning of the pandemic and spending on health services is growing at pre-pandemic levels.",
            "In 2022,price growth in the health sectorhas been slower than general economic inflation. However, thecumulative increasein health prices in the past two decades continue to surpassoverall prices. It is unclear whether growth in prices of goods andlabor costsin 2022 will eventually flow through to the health sector. It is possible the federal government’s price-setting for Medicare may somewhat moderate inflation in the health sector.",
            "The coronavirus pandemic compounded pre-existing barriers to accessing care in the U.S. In 2021,21%of adults in the U.S. either delayed or did not get care due to pandemic-related barriers.",
            "Health servicesuse droppedearly in the pandemic as steps were taken to avoid in-person spread of COVID-19. Virtual care delivered via telehealth somewhat filled the need for accessing care. However, as ofOctober 2022, inpatient care still had not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels.",
            "As with overall health costs, there has been a similar rise in out-of-pocket spending in recent years. Americans spent a total of$433 billionout of their own pockets on healthcare in 2021, an increase ofmore than 10.4%from the $392 billion spent the previous year. Out-of-pocket spending had fallen in 2020, primarily driven by the drop in utilization of health services when social distancing recommendations were put in place early in the pandemic. However, as healthcare utilization rebounded, so did out-of-pocket spending.",
            "Higher health costs in the U.S. leave Americanspaying more out-of-pocketat the point of care ($1,315 per person) than people in peer nations ($825 per person), on average.",
            "Patient cost-sharing responsibility, particularly for people withserious conditions, can quickly add up. For example,out-of-pocket costsfor inpatient COVID-19 admissions among people with large employer coverage averaged $1,880 in 2020 (for admissions with at least some cost-sharing). Large employer plan enrollees’emergency department visits cost $646out-of-pocket, on average. Privately insuredwomen who give birth pay almost $3,000more out-of-pocket than women their same age who don’t give birth. Among privately insured people with large employer insurance,1 in 5 taking insulin pay over $35 monthly.",
            "While cost sharing is intended to encourage patients to make cost-effective decisions, it can also make care prohibitively expensive. Even though thevast majorityof Americans have health insurance,1 in 10adults in the U.S. either delayed care or did not get care due to cost. Hispanic people in particular were more likely to be impacted by cost-related barriers to care, experiencinghigherrates ofdelaying or not getting medical careand higher rates ofdifficulty paying medical bills. People with incomes below200% of the Federal Poverty Level(FPL) are also more likely to delay or go without medical care due to costs than those with higher incomes.",
            "Out-of-pocket costs can also send American families, many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck, intomedical debt. Among multi-person households with private health insurance about a third do not have enoughliquid assetsto pay a typical deductible ($2,000), and half (51%) could not pay a high-deductible or out-of-pocket maximum ($6,000). Further, maximum allowableout-of-pocket limits have grown much faster than wagesand salaries under some private health plans.",
            "Using federal survey data, we estimate people in the U.S. owed at least$195 billion in medical debtin 2019, and most people with medical debt owed over$1,000. The burden of medical debt is experienced disproportionately by people of color. For example, a higher share of Black adultsreported having medical debtthan any other race or ethnicity group. People of color remain more likely to be of lower income, living in a Medicaid non-expansion state, anduninsured—all of which contributes to their higher medical debt rate.",
            "The coronavirus pandemic has had a profound effect on Americans’ health, and its impact on the health care system will likely last beyond the acute stage of the pandemic. The pandemic hasshortened life expectancyin the U.S. andexacerbated health disparitiesandhealth access barriers. Although out-of-pocket spending dropped in 2020, this was primarily driven bylower utilizationof non-COVID-19 care amid social distancing. As healthcare use has rebounded more recently, out-of-pocket spending has grown sharply relative to 2020.",
            "Looking ahead to 2023, there are several challenges the U.S. health system is likely to face in the coming year. First, the pandemic is not over. Althoughdeath ratesare not at their peak and vaccines haveprevented countless deaths, COVID-19 is on track to once again be the third leading cause of death in 2022. The uptake of booster shots – needed to maintain a robust immune response against the virus –has been low, even among those most at risk.",
            "Utilization of healthcare is rebounding after having been suppressed in the early pandemic, but health sector employmentremains below expected levelsbased on pre-pandemic trends.Telemedicinehas opened new pathways to access care, particularly tomeet mental health needs, but it is not a replacement for in-person care and does not alleviate the strain on providers.",
            "Although health coverage rates have improved with pandemic-related federal initiatives in recent years, many people willlose Medicaidwhen pandemic continuous coverage ends, as eligibility redeterminations resume in 2023. Additionally, as federal pandemic emergency funds run out and thePublic Health Emergency ends, COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and treatments are likely to become more costly for someindividuals(particularly the uninsured andunder-insured) and forsocietymore broadly.",
            "Finally, health costscontinue to rise,and health spending is representing a growing share of the U.S. economy and families’ budgets. Many American familieslack the financial resourcesto afford typical out-of-pocket costs in private health plans. There have been some federal policy responses to address the cost of care for patients and public programs. For example, theNo Surprises Actprohibits balance billing and sets an arbitration process for payments in case plan and provider negotiations fall through. And theInflation Reduction Actwill limit the growth in drug spending, as well as eventually allow negotiations in Medicare pricing for certain drugs. These measures are relatively narrowly focused, but could open the door for future policymaking addressing the underlying cost of care.",

            "The high cost of emergency care may impact patients’ability to afford treatment, with almost half of US adults reporting they havedelayedcare due to costs. Almost 1 in 10 Americans havemedical debt, and about half of American households do not have theliquid assetsto afford an average employer sponsored plan deductible. More than one third of US adults are unable toafforda $400 medical expense without borrowing.",
            "Costs of medical emergencies present an additional financial burden on top of already costly health insurancepremiumsranging $1,327 for single coverage and $6,106 for family coverage, on average, for workers with employer sponsored insurance. Variation in emergency department billing may make it difficult topredictthe cost of an emergency department visit and subsequent financial liability. Recently, theNo Surprises Actlegislation aimed to curb unexpected emergency medical costs by prohibiting out-of-network billing for emergency services.",
            "In this analysis, we use 2019 insurance claims data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, which captures privately insured individuals with large employer health plans. We look at the total and out-of-pocket costs of emergency department visits for this group, overall and by diagnosis and severity level. We also look at which services contribute most to the costs of emergency department visits and examine regional variation in emergency department costs. Finally, we look at the demographic profile of consumers who visited the emergency department and the relationship between emergency department spending and annual spending for enrollees.",
            "We find that enrollees spend $646 out-of-pocket, on average, for an emergency department visit. Enrollees with high annual health spending were more likely to visit the emergency department; the majority of enrollees in the top 10% of annual health care spending had at least one emergency department visit during the year. The most expensive components of most emergency department visits include evaluation and management charges, imaging, and laboratory studies, and facility fees make up 80% of the cost of visits. Cost varies by disease, visit complexity, and geographic region.",
            "On average, enrollees in large employer health plans who have an emergency department visit spend $646 out-of-pocket on the visit. There is significant variation in emergency department spending, with 25% of visits costing over $907 out-of-pocket and another quarter costing less than $128 out-of-pocket. These out-of-pocket costs for a single emergency department visit may be more than some people with private insurance can afford and, in some cases, could entirely deplete a consumer’s savings. For example, about1-in-5people (21%) with private insurance living in single-person households have less than $1,000 in liquid assets.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "These amounts only include out-of-pocket spending required by the insurer. Before theNo Surprises Actwent into effect in January 2022, privately insured patients who visited the emergency departmentfrequentlyhad out-of-network claims on their visit, putting them at risk of providers sending them surprise balance bills. The No Surprises Act now prohibits most surprise out-of-network billing, but does not apply toground ambulances. Any balance bill that a patient received from a provider would not appear in claims data and therefore would have been in addition to the out-of-pocket amounts shown here.",
            "In total, enrollees and insurers paid $2,453, on average, per visit, with one quarter of visits costing $970 or less and another quarter costing $3,043 or more. All the costs described in this analysis are for the emergency department visits only, including professional services and facility fees, and do not include any spending on subsequent hospitalizations.",
            "Emergency department bills are categorized asfacility feesor professional fees. Professional fees are for services provided by clinicians, and facility fees include bills for services rendered using equipment owned by the facility, including laboratory or imaging studies. These fees are considered “overhead” for emergency departments and help facilities maintain appropriate staffing levels and technical resources. Evaluation and management charges also have a facility fee component for the equipment, staffing, and administrative resources used by the physician in their management. We find that facility fees make up 80% of total visit cost.",
            "Including both the professional fee and facility fee components of charges, the largest contributor to spending on a typical emergency department visit is the evaluation and management charge, which accounts for almost half (44%) of average visit costs. Evaluation and management charges are bills for the assessment of a patient that are not related to specific procedures or treatments provided; these services cost over $1,100 per visit, on average.",
            "Imaging charges, including radiologist interpretation fees, make up an additional 19% of the average emergency department visit charge and cost $483, on average. The highest cost routinely performed imaging services include x-rays of the chest and CT scans of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Over half of visits (55%) include a charge for imaging services. About half of patients (49%) are charged for laboratory studies, including blood tests, which cost $230 on average. Other high cost but less common charges include surgical charges for patients with appendicitis and other conditions requiring surgery without inpatient admission, as well as ambulance charges for transport.",
            "Costs of emergency department visits depend on diagnosis. We selected nine common reasons to visit the emergency department that vary in complexity of management. More severe conditions, or those with more intervention required, are the most expensive. Of the nine specific diagnoses that we evaluated, the lower-cost diagnoses were those that generally do not require imaging or extensive treatment in the emergency department. These included upper respiratory tract infections ($1,535 total, $523 out-of-pocket), skin and soft tissue infections ($2,005 total, $572 out-of-pocket), and urinary tract infections ($2,726 total, $683 out-of-pocket). While these diagnoses can occasionally require admission to the hospital, in otherwise healthy adults they are typically evaluated with basic laboratory studies and discharged with prescriptions.",
            "The most expensive emergency department diagnosis among those we examined is appendicitis, which, on average, costs $9,535 ($1,717 out-of-pocket) per visit. Appendicitis is almost two times as expensive as the next most expensive diagnosis we looked at, heart attack. 11% of enrollees with a diagnosis of appendicitis had surgical charges associated with their emergency department visit. Surgical costs may be included in emergency department outpatient billing because these patients are often discharged after surgery without being admitted to the hospital. In contrast, other emergency department visits requiring surgery are often admitted to the hospital and have surgical charges during their inpatient visit. Enrollees who had surgery had more expensive visits by over $2,000 compared to those who did not; however even without surgery, visits for appendicitis were almost four times as expensive as the average emergency department visit (and more than twice as expensive out-of-pocket).",
            "In addition to the costs of the emergency department visit itself, enrollees who visit the emergency department at least once during the year have higher annual health care spending. Annual spending includes the cost of all claims for each patient in 2019, either before or after their emergency department visit. Though appendicitis was the most expensive emergency department visit among the diagnoses we analyzed, enrollees with appendicitis in 2019 incurred an average of $24,333 in additional health care spending, which was comparable to lower cost diagnoses. Enrollees with heart attacks had at least two times more annual spending than any other diagnosis ($52,993), while enrollees with upper respiratory tract infections had the lowest annual spending ($13,727).",
            "These differences in annual costs may reflect spending both directly related and unrelated to the emergency department visit. For example, enrollees with heart attack emergency department visits may have high annual spending because of follow-up, medications, or hospitalizations after their heart attacks. However, their high annual spending may also reflect more comorbidities and higher healthcare utilization at baseline. In contrast, appendicitis, the most expensive emergency department visit, is correlated with relatively lower annual costs; unlike heart attacks, appendicitis often occurs in younger, healthier people and requires comparatively little additional post-surgical follow-up or treatment.",
            "Emergency department visits are coded by complexity during the billing process, from 1 (least complex) to 5 (most complex). Each evaluation and management charge is associated with a procedure code ranging from level 1 to level 5 (99281 to 99285), which are generated by hospital coding professionals based on the physicians’ medical note. Criteria are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and based on the complexity of documentation and medical decision making. Patients with level 1 complexity codes require straightforward medical decision making, with self-limited or minor presenting problems, such as rashes or medication refills. Patients with level 5 codes require high complexity medical decision making and present with life- or limb-threatening conditions, such as severe infections or cardiac arrests.",
            "The lowest complexity visits cost $592 on average, with enrollees responsible for $205, or about one-third of the total visit cost. As visits increase in complexity, both out-of-pocket costs and costs covered by insurance increase. For the highest complexity visits, the health plan covers $3,015 on average, or eight times the cost of the lowest complexity visits. On average, patients pay $840 out-of-pocket for the highest complexity visits, which is four times their out-of-pocket costs for the lowest complexity visits.",
            "Higher complexity visits are more expensive for multiple reasons. In general, evaluation and management charges are higher cost for more complex patients. Also, patients with more complex medical conditions generally receive more diagnostic tests, medication, and other treatment, which increases the cost of the visit. For the lowest complexity visits, evaluation and management charges account for almost half (47%) of the overall visit cost. In contrast, evaluation and management charges for the highest complexity visits account for about one-fourth (27%) of the total visit cost, with additional services including tests and treatment making up a larger share of the cost.",
            "We analyzed the top 20 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) by population, where data are available. Overall, the San Diego, CA area had the most expensive average ED visits ($3,761 on average). San Diego ED visits were more than twice as expensive as Baltimore, MD, the least expensive MSA in our analysis ($1,645 on average). Expensive MSAs were geographically distributed in all regions of the country including the South, West, Northeast, and Midwest. Within each MSA, there was significant variation in visit costa. For example, 25% of visits in Oakland, CA cost less than $1,236 on average, while 25% cost more than $4,436 on average.",
            "Some variation may be based on the distribution of diagnoses in each area, with more serious or complex diagnoses leading to higher cost visits. For example, if a metro area sees higher than average volume of appendicitis, heart attacks, or other high-cost diagnoses, that would drive up regional emergency department costs.",
            "If we examine costs for specific diagnoses, we can minimize some of this variation in reasons for visits and gain a better understanding of how prices and service intensity affect the rankings. We selected two common, moderate-cost reasons for emergency department visits: low back pain and lower respiratory infections. While these visits can range in complexity and treatment required, they usually do not require hospital admission or high-cost treatment. Low back pain includes patients who present with the symptom of low back pain, regardless of diagnosis. Lower respiratory tract infection includes infectious causes of pneumonia and bronchitis. This analysis was limited to MSAs in which there were >500 cases of each diagnosis in 2019.",
            "Visit costs for both diagnoses in Dallas, TX, Houston, TX, Fort Worth, TX, and Orlando, FL are in the top five most expensive MSAs with >500 cases. For low back pain visits, the Orlando, FL, Fort Worth, TX, Dallas, TX, and Houston, TX areas are each more than twice as expensive as the Warren, MI and Detroit, MI areas, on average. This trend is similar for lower respiratory tract infections. Within MSAs, variation in costs exist for both diagnoses. For example, for low back pain visits, there is more than a $3,000 difference between the least expensive and most expensive quarter of visits in Fort Worth, TX, Dallas, TX, and Houston, TX.",
            "We find that 12% of large group enrollees under age 65 had at least one emergency department visit in 2019, and of enrollees with emergency department visits, 80% had only one visit. 20% had more than one visit, and 7% had more than two visits. Emergency department visits were associated with higher annual health care spending, with almost half of enrollees in the top 25% of annual spending having at least one emergency department visit during the year.",
            "We find that the average emergency department visit exceeds the threshold that some consumers can pay without borrowing, and even one emergency department visit in a year may create financial hardship for enrollees in large employer plans. For example, one quarter of emergency department visits for large employer enrollees cost over $907 out-of-pocket. Meanwhile, about1-in-5people with private insurance do not have $1,000 in liquid assets, andalmost halfof US adults report that they would not be able to pay a $500 medical bill without going into debt. Emergency department visits range significantly in cost depending on diagnosis, visit complexity, and geographic area. These variations may present challenges for consumers trying to predict the cost of their emergency department visit prior to going to the emergency department.",
            "Several factors contribute to the variability of emergency department charges. First, unlike other forms of outpatient care including primary care or urgent care visits, emergency departments charge facility fees to offset the cost of keeping emergency departments open and staffed 24/7. These fees vary widely and are increasing at afaster ratethan overall health care spending. The facility component represented 80% of total emergency department spending in our analysis. Many hospitals and health care providers consider these costs necessary given theirmandateto provide emergency triage and treatment to allcomers. A second contributor to variation is that services are often billed at different complexity levels, and visits that are billed as more complex aremore expensive. In some cases, even similar services are billed atdifferent pricesby different facilities. Notably, surpriseout-of-networkmedical bills from emergency departments have contributed to high emergency costs for consumers, though the cost of any balance bills would be outside the scope of our claims data. The implementation of theNo Surprises Actin January 2022 will generally curb surprise medical billing for emergency care.",
            "As seen in non-emergencyspending, we find that emergency department costs vary by geographic area. Among the most expensive MSAs in our analysis were MSAs located in Texas, Florida, California, Colorado, and New York. Interestingly, the most expensive regions for ED care do not align with themostexpensiveregions for overall health care spending. These comparisons suggest that our findings are not solely related to overall high health care prices in these areas and may reflect other factors including the age and medical complexity of the population or differences in localnormsand practice patterns. State-level emergency department regulation may also play a role—states with higher numbers offreestanding, non-hospital affiliated emergency departments (which are associated withhigherspendingon emergency care) were among the most costly in our analysis.",
            "The financial implications of visiting the emergency department vary widely. Not all the variation in total charges is reflected in out-of-pocket costs, since differences in cost by complexity level are smaller after insurance covers its portion of the bill. However, the most complex emergency department visits have four times higher out-of-pocket costs than the least complex visits. Even the least complex visits, some of which could be treated by a primary care office or urgent care center, cost an average of $205 out-of-pocket ($592 total). Given facility fees and relatively high evaluation and management charges in emergency departments, insurers and patients are paying more when receiving care for these conditions at emergency departments than they would using primary or urgent care. These lower complexity visits may represent a substantialavoidablecostto patients and the health care system at large.",
            "High health care costs are of foremostconcernfor US adults, leading people to skip recommended medical treatment or delay necessary care. Even in the era of newprice transparencyregulation, which aims to improve consumer access to prices for elective care, emergency department consumers often do not know what testing or treatment they will need, so it is difficult to assess the costs of a visit upfront. Further, in an emergency situation, patients may not be able tochoose their provideror facility if they are brought in by ambulance or otherwise unable to direct their care. Lastly, lack ofavailability and standardizationin data may make it difficult for patients to use price transparency data in real time to make decisions about accepting tests and treatment in an emergency. The high and variable cost of emergency department visits represents an opportunity for future policy changes to protect consumers from unaffordable medical bills.",
            "This analysis is based on data from the Merative MarketScan Commercial Database, which contains claims information provided by a sample of large employer plans. Enrollees in MarketScan claims data were included if they were enrolled for 12 months. This analysis used claims for almost 14 million people representing about 17% of the 85 million people in large group market plans (employers with a thousand or more workers) from 2004-2019. To make MarketScan data representative of large group plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age, state, and whether the enrollee was a policy holder or dependent.",
            "Emergency department visits were flagged if an enrollee had an emergency department evaluation and management claim in the emergency department or the hospital on a given day. If an enrollee had either an emergency evaluation and management claim or another claim originating in the emergency department on the day prior to or after the flagged day, we added the previous and or following day’s outpatient spending to the visit cost. This was to capture all emergency department services for visits that may have spanned overnight or multiple days. Over half (53%) of the spending in this analysis occurred in the emergency department, with another 42% occurring in the hospital, which may occur when a patient receives a test or procedure in a location outside the emergency department during their visit.",
            "Claims were included if they were above $100 and below the 99.5thpercentile of cost. Selected conditions were generated from a literature review of common emergency department diagnoses and defined using ICD10 codes. Enrollees were considered to have a certain diagnosis if the relevant ICD10 code appeared in the “Diagnosis 1” column in one or more claims on an emergency department visit day. While emergency department claims have up to four diagnoses, diagnoses listed in 2-4 were not used to identify relevant conditions because these diagnoses were most often incidentally found rather than related to the reason for presenting to the emergency department. For specific diagnosis definitions: Heart attack includes acute STEMI and NSTEMI, and excludes complications from prior heart attacks or angina; UTI includes acute cystitis, UTI and pyelonephritis; Kidney stone includes renal calculus in any location and renal colic; Lower respiratory infection includes pneumonia and bronchitis. Surgical charges for acute appendicitis include both open and laparoscopic surgical charges. Annual spending was defined as the total spending for each enrollee in the year 2019, which could occur before and/or after their emergency department visit depending on the time of year of the emergency department visit.",
            "This analysis has some limitations. First, there is a chance that we could incorrectly include non-emergency outpatient care (such as a next-day, follow up primary care appointment) in our estimate of emergency department visit costs. Secondly, when accounting for annual spending, we do not control for health status prior to the emergency department visit. Therefore, the increase in annual health spending for patients who visit the emergency department for certain conditions may be because these patients are sicker and higher healthcare utilizers at baseline, rather than specific follow-up costs incurred for the emergency department visit itself. For selecting relevant diagnoses, we only include claims in which a particular diagnosis occurs as the primary diagnosis. Third, the MarketScan database includes only charges incurred under the enrollees’ plan and do not include balance billing to enrollees which may have occurred. Lastly, our findings only represent enrollees in large group employer sponsored plans and may not be generalizable to other groups.",

            "In addition to its devastating health toll, COVID-19 can also lead to significant financial costs for people needing treatment and for public and private payers. In this chart collection, we examine the cost of COVID-19 treatment for inpatient care among people with health coverage through large employers.",
            "We find that, in 2020, COVID-19 hospitalizations cost an average of $41,611, including an average out-of-pocket payment of $1,280 for people with large employer coverage. In 2020, many private insurers and employerstemporarily waivedout-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 treatment (this is generallyno longerthe case). For COVID-19 hospitalizations with some cost-sharing expense, an average of $1,880 was spent out-of-pocket by individuals with large employer coverage.",
            "As we show in the following charts, COVID-19 hospitalization costs vary widely for patients with private insurance. This analysis focuses on people with large employer coverage and does not reflect costs for patients with Medicaid or Medicare. At this time, 2020 is the most recent year of available data, and hospitalization and other treatment costs may have changed with the introduction of newer treatments.",
            "In the chart above, we examined the average amount paid for COVID-19 hospital admissions in 2020. On average, the amount paid by the plan and the enrollee combined totaled $41,611.",
            "The average out-of-pocket cost associated with a COVID-19 hospitalization was $1,280 in 2020. However, many insurers temporarily waived out-of-pocket costs in 2020 and most had stopped waiving these costs by late 2021. As a result, this average (which includes many hospitalizations with $0 in out-of-pocket costs) may not be an accurate representation of the typical out-of-pocket liability patients experience today. Out-of-pocket average costs for inpatient COVID-19 treatment in 2021 and 2022 are likely to be higher than in 2020, as these voluntary waivers became uncommon.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health Spending",
            "Looking only at admissions with at least some out-of-pocket spending, the average out-of-pocket spending was $1,880. (Note that some patients may pay $0 out-of-pocket due to COVID-19 specific cost-sharing waivers, while some may have already met a plan deductible or out-of-pocket limit.)",
            "In general, hospitalization costs can vary widely based on factors such asseverityandprices, and COVID-19 is no exception.",
            "Among people with large employer-based health coverage, half of COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 cost over $25,000 and a quarter cost over $38,000. The exceptionally high-cost cases bring the average cost to above $40,000. As shown below, hospitalizations that include a stay in intensive care (ICU) are significantly more expensive than those that do not.",
            "In 2020, many insurers and employerswaived out-of-pocket costsfor COVID-19 treatment. Still, we find 68% of COVID-19 admissions in 2020 had at least some out-of-pocket costs.",
            "Among COVID-19 hospitalizations with cost sharing, half had out-of-pocket costs over $1,470, and a quarter had out-of-pocket costs exceeding $2,900.",
            "About 38% of COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 among people with large employer-sponsored insurance included an intensive care unit (ICU) stay in 2020. Among COVID-19 admissions with ICU treatment, the average cost was $65,569, more than double that for COVID-19 admissions without intensive care ($26,952).",
            "COVID-19 ICU stays in 2020 were more costly on average than other ICU stays. Among other patients who required ICU care but did not have COVID-19, the average hospitalization for people with large employer-sponsored insurance cost $49,560.",
            "While ICU admissions more than twice as expensive on average as admissions without intensive care, the amount paid by patients out-of-pocket was similar (likely because patients admitted to the hospital tend to reach their deductible or out-of-pocket maximum). Average out-of-pocket costs for an ICU hospitalization was $1,380, while for a hospitalization without an ICU stay it was $1,219. However, ICU patients with at least some cost-sharing had higher out-of-pocket costs for ICU COVID-19 admissions, averaging $1,966.",
            "COVID-19 admissions were longer than other admissions, with an average COVID-19 admission lasting 7 days compared to 4 days for other admissions.",
            "The total cost of inpatient treatment for COVID-19 for individuals with large employer coverage averaged over $40,000, and patient out-of-pocket costs commonly exceeded $1,000. In 2020, some individuals received cost-sharing waivers and were not liable for any out-of-pocket costs associated with their COVID-19 treatment. However, most hospitalized patients with large employer coverage were responsible for at least some out-of-pocket payments, and these payments frequently exceeded one thousand dollars. Among privately insured non-elderly households in 2019, 21% of single-person households and 13% of multi-person households hadliquid assetsof less than $1,000. This can lead to financial hardship and difficulty covering the cost of a COVID-19 hospitalization, despite the patient’s insured status.",
            "Most of the total cost of COVID-19 treatment is covered by an insurer if the patient’s employer is fully insured, or the employer itself if it is self-insured. This may put upward pressure on premiums in future years, affecting all enrollees, regardless of whether they had a COVID-19 hospitalization. However, the pandemic also saw a decrease in patients seeking other forms of care, including elective procedures. Insurers generally expected the pandemic to have asmall effecton premiums in 2023.",
            "We used 2020 MarketScan inpatient data. COVID-19 hospital admission was identified if test confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or a diagnosis related to COVID-19 encounter (pneumonia, acute bronchitis, lower respiratory infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome) was present on the admission day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced COVID-19 codingguidancein February 2020 prior to establishing a COVID-19 ICD-10 diagnosis code in early April 2020. We used the coding guidance and the ICD-10 diagnosis U07.1 code to identify COVID-19 hospital admissions. Enrollee claims were trimmed at top 99.5thpercentile of total costs and 10% of the bottom 50thpercentile of total costs. Average total and out-of-pocket costs were summed for the admission.",
            "MarketScan data were weighted to be representative of enrollees with large employer health plans (employers with a thousand or more workers).

            "Note: For our prior analysis on COVID-19 mortality preventable by vaccines, clickhere.",
            "This brief examines how deaths from COVID-19 rank among other leading causes of death in the U.S. At the time of this brief, COVID-19 is on track to be the third leading cause of death in the U.S. for the third year in a row. COVID-19 claimed 340,000 lives in 2020, 475,000 lives in 2021, and so far, has taken 230,000 lives in 2022 through September.",
            "We find that nearly as many people died of COVID-19 in January and February of 2022 as the typical deaths from heart disease, though COVID-19 deaths have declined since then. We also find that in January and February of 2022, COVID-19 was the number 1 cause of death for people ages 45-84 and among at least the top 4 leading causes of death for other age groups (age five and up). The number of COVID-19 deaths has since declined, but the pandemic remains a leading cause of death in the U.S.",
            "The chart above combines data on COVID-19 mortality rates fromKFF’s trackerwith data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) onweekly countsof death by jurisdiction and cause of death andmonthly provisionalcounts of deaths by select causes.",
            "So far in 2022 in the U.S., COVID-19 is the number 3 cause of death (through September). However, about half of COVID-19 deaths in 2022 thus far occurred in January and February of the year.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Over the course of the pandemic, COVID-19 has frequently ranked among the top 3 leading causes of death in the U.S. Looking at data on deaths fromCOVID-19andothercauses, in October 2022, COVID-19 took the lives of about 344 people per day on average. By comparison, heart disease, which is typically the number one cause of death in the U.S. each year, led to the death of about 2,000 people per day and cancer claimed nearly 1,700 lives per day, on average, based on data from 2022.",
            "Based on average daily deaths, COVID-19 was the number 6 cause of death in October 2022 below accidents, strokes, and chronic lower respiratory disease. COVID-19 daily average deaths in the month were closely followed by diabetes and Alzheimer disease. Since deaths from other leading causes below accidents are fairly close, COVID-19’s rank tends to fluctuate. COVID-19 ranked #5 in September 2022, closely tied with number of average daily deaths from strokes.",
            "The chart above shows how COVID-19 compares among the top 10 leading causes of death for each age group 5 and older for cumulative COVID-19 deaths in January through September 2022. To rank COVID-19 among other leading causes of death by age groups, we looked atCOVID-19deaths for each age group and the most recent available data for other “rankable” age-specific leading causes for the period of January to September 2022. The number of deaths caused by COVID-19 are available for recent months, but the number of deaths from accidents, suicides, and homicides in the most recent months are incomplete. Therefore, for each age group, we assume the number of deaths that arose from these other leading causes were similar to those in the first 9 months of 2021. We do not include children under age 5 in age-specific COVID ranking because there are relatively few deaths from any cause, meaning that the rankings of leading causes in each month can be influenced by even a small change in the number of deaths from a given cause.",
            "COVID-19 was among the top 4 leading causes of death for all groups age 5 and older in January 2022. COVID-19 claimed 2,045 lives in January 2022 and 2,194 lives in February 2022, which is more than the number of deaths from heart disease in January 2019. (Since COVID-19 emerged, the number of deaths attributed to heart disease has tended to increase at the same time COVID-19 deaths surge).",
            "In January 2022, COVID-19 ranked as the number 1 cause of death for people age 45 and over as well as number 2 for people ages 25-44. Among leading causes of death, COVID-19 was number 3 among children age 5-14 and number 4 among young people age 15-24.",
            "However, starting in March and continuing through most of the year, COVID-19 has fallen in ranking as a leading cause of death across age groups. In September 2022, COVID-19 ranked as the 5thor 6thleading cause of death for elderly people in the U.S., and the 8thor 9thleading cause for most other age groups.",
            "COVID-19 is on track to be the third leading cause of death in 2022, just as it was in 2021 and 2020, even with much higher primary series vaccination, in part because booster rates have been low. COVID-19 deaths tend to ebb and flow in waves. However, deaths have spiked in both winters since the virus emerged, so, despite a plateau in COVID-19 deaths in recent months, it is possible there will be another surge this winter. How big a winter surge in infections might be is uncertain, and the extent to which it translates into larger numbers of deaths will likely depend on booster uptake in the coming months.",
            "We used theKFF COVID-19 Trackerdata through November 4, 2022 for average daily and monthly total COVID-19 deaths in the United States for all ages. For data on deaths due to other “rankable” leading causes of death for all ages, we used CDCmonthly provisionalandweekly countsfor select causes of death. Heart disease deaths were combined for all circulatory diseases except stroke. Chronic respiratory or respiratory represents chronic lower respiratory disease. Other respiratory includes other diseases of the lungs such as acute and lower respiratory disease. Stroke represents cerebrovascular disease.",
            "For age-specific ranking of COVID-19 among other leading causes of death, we used CDC provisional COVID-19 deaths databy age and month. For other leading causes, we used CDC provisional death counts for other leadingcausessummed for each month through September 2022 where available. For remaining rankable leading causes, we usedCDC Wonderdata for average monthly death counts by age group in 2020.",

            "An important component of most private insurance plans is the out-of-pocket (OOP) limit. These limits place an annual cap on the amount of cost-sharing (deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) an enrollee can face for in-network covered services each year. By doing so, OOP limits provide significant financial protection for individuals who face substantial health care use in a year. Even so, these limits aretypicallyseveral thousand dollars for covered workers enrolled in single coverage; families in which multiple people have health spending may face significant cost-sharing before reaching the limit.",
            "This analysis uses economic projections to look at how the maximum allowable OOP limits may change for different types of private health insurance plans over the next decade. We show that, based on current projections, the ACA’s maximum out-of-pocket limit is likely to grow faster than wages and salaries, and is also expected to grow faster than the maximum out-of-pocket limit for HSA-qualified health plans.",
            "The share of covered workers enrolled in an employer-sponsored health plan with an OOP limit has grown over time, and todayvirtually allcovered workers are enrolled in a plan which includes an OOP limit for in-network services.",
            "The increasing share of the privately insured people covered by a plan with an OOP limit is in part a result of regulations, including the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 and the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Starting in 2004, HSA-qualified health plans allow enrollees and employers to make tax-preferred contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs), when paired with a plan that includes a minimum deductible and has an OOP limit that did not exceed the maximum allowed by law. Over time, HSA-qualified plans have become commonplace, now coveringone-fifthof covered workers. The maximum out-of-pocket limit for a single-coverage HSA-qualified health plan in 2022 is $7,050.",
            "The ACA further expanded the prevalence of OOP limits by requiring that all non-grandfathered private health plans, including employer plans, adopt this feature for plan years starting after 2014. Under the ACA, the maximum allowable OOP limit for in-network covered services in other non-grandfathered private health insurance plans is $8,700 in 2022.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health plans can and do set lower OOP limits than federally mandated maximums. Among covered workers with an OOP limit, the average OOP limit for single coverage is$4,272, but there is considerablevariationin the size of these limits amongst those enrolled in employer-sponsored plans. In 2021, almost a quarter of covered workers had an OOP limit of more than$6,000for single coverage. Out-of-pocket limits in theACA Marketplaceplans vary by metal level and whether the enrollee qualifies for a cost-sharing reduction based on their income. Silver plans in 2022 had amaximum OOP limitof $8,209, on average; the maximum OOP limits are much lower for those with a cost-sharing subsidy (an average of $1,208 for the lowest-income Marketplace enrollees).",
            "The maximum allowable OOP limits for HSA-qualified health plans and other private health plans increase each year. However, the two types of maximum OOP limits are pegged to separate measures and therefore grow at different rates. Themaximum OOP limit for HSA-qualified plansis indexed to the overall chained-consumer price index for all urban consumers (chained-CPI-U). TheACA maximum OOP limit, which applies to other non-grandfathered private health plans, is instead inflated by the growth of employer-sponsored health insurance premiums as determined by the National Health Expenditure Accounts.",
            "Historically, the growth in employer-sponsored health insurance premiums has outpaced general economicinflation. When the ACA’s maximum OOP limit went into effect in 2014, it was set at the same amount as that for HSA-qualified health plans, which was $6,350 for single coverage and $12,700 for family coverage. Differences in the indexing methodology have led to a growing gap in the maximum OOP limits for these two types of plans. In 2022, HSA-qualified health plans are required to have an OOP limit of $7,050 or less for single coverage, compared to $8,700 or less for other non-grandfathered private plans.",
            "Using projections provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS’) National Health Expenditure Accounts, we look at how these limits may grow over time. Given employer-based health insurance premiums are projected to increase faster than workers’ wages, enrollees in private health plans hitting their OOP limit would be committing a larger share of their income to out-of-pocket costs in the coming years.",
            "While during recent months overallinflationhas been growing at over 8% over last year, the CBO recently projected that chained-CPI-U will grow at roughly 2% per year over the next decade. If these projections hold the maximum OOP limit for HSA-qualified plans will grow to $8,750 by 2030 for single coverage.",
            "By contrast, CMS projects that employer-based health insurance spending will grow over 4% per year during the period. If these estimates hold, the ACA maximum OOP limit for other non-grandfathered private health plan single coverage will be $12,500 in 2030, which is over 40% higher than the maximum OOP limit for HSA-qualified plans in 2030.",
            "There is considerable uncertainty in economic forecasts, making future OOP limits hard to estimate. In recent months, overallpriceshave grown at relatively high levels and at a faster pace than prices for health services. How overall prices and employer-based health insurance premium grow in the coming months and years will determine at what level future maximum OOP limits are set. Over time health insurance premiums have grown faster than inflation, a trend predicted to continue, even if the exact levels cannot be precisely estimated.",
            "Wages and salaries have outpaced growth in out-of-pocket limits for HSA-qualified plans, but the ACA maximum out-of-pocket limit is growing faster than wages. By next year, the ACA maximum OOP limit for other non-grandfathered private health plans will have increased 43% from $6,350 in 2014 to $9,100 in 2023. By comparison, the maximum OOP limit for HSA-qualified health plans will have grown by 18% from $6,350 in 2014 to $7,500 in 2023. Meanwhile, wages and salaries are expected to grow by 31% over the same period.",
            "Between 2014 and 2033, CBO expects wages to grow by 83%, while we project that the ACA’s maximum OOP limit will grow by 122% over the same period.",
            "Over time, pegging the growth of the ACA’s maximum out-of-pocket limit to health spending means that enrollees who are subject to the maximum allowable out-of-pocket limit may have to commit a larger share of their income to their out-of-pocket health costs. By contrast, pegging growth in HSA-qualified plan’s OOP limits to prices in the economy results in a slower level of growth over time.",
            "Our finding that the ACA’s maximum out-of-pocket limit is rising faster than wages has implications for affordability of health care, particularly for those with higher levels of health spending. An out-of-pocket limit is a significant financial protection for enrollees who face high cost-sharing and have high health care needs by limiting how much enrollees must pay in coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles. However, as out-of-pocket limits grow, and particularly as they outpace wages and salaries, they offer less protection. Our previous analysis found that many households with private health insurance coveragedo not have sufficient savings to meet the typical OOP limitsin employer-based and ACA Marketplace plans.",
            "One potential policy option to address affordability for people with significant health care needs would be to reduce the ACA’s maximum out-of-pocket limit or to change the way it is indexed to bring it down over time. However, that could come with its own set of trade-offs arising from how the out-of-pocket limit interacts with other aspects of the ACA. In particular, the ACA requires plans sold to individuals and in the small group market to meet actuarial value standards within each metal level. For example, a silver plan should generally cover about 70% of the total health costs for a population, while the plan’s enrollees pay the remaining 30% out of their own pockets. If the plan’s out-of-pocket maximum is lowered, then insurers would need to adjust cost-sharing (deductibles, copayment, coinsurance) in order to maintain the same actuarial value. With a lower out-of-pocket limit, sicker people (or those whoneed significant health careand hit their OOP limit) would save money, while healthier people (or those who do not hit their OOP limit) would pay more than they currently do.",
            "The diverging growth rates for these maximum out-of-pocket limits has a two-fold implication for thecostof private health plans. On one hand, enrollees with HSA-qualified health plans (who hit their OOP limit) have more financial protection from in-network cost sharing at the point of care over time. On the other, HSA-qualified private health plans will not be able to shift as much of the total costs to enrollees with a lower maximum OOP limit. That means, HSA-qualified health plan premiums will rise faster than for other non-grandfathered private health plans. Premium costs aresharedwith employers, while out-of-pocket cost sharing is paid almost entirely by enrollees. Lowering maximum out-of-pocket limits helps people with significant health needs, but it does nothing to lower overall health system costs paid by society.",
            "Current Year Historical Data and Economic Projections reflect the Congressional Budget Office’s estimates as ofMay 2022. Wages and salaries are based on the employment cost index as describedhere. Projections of employer-sponsored Insurance (ESI) are from CMS’sNational Health Expenditure Accounts, Table 17. ESI cost growth for 2031 and 2032 is estimated based on prior year growth projections.",

            "Each year, health insurers submit rate filings to state regulators, detailing their expectations for the coming year’s health costs. These filings can provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year, including inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic, and policy changes.",
            "In this analysis, we reviewed rate filings from plans participating in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces to track what insurers say will be driving premium growth in the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. At the time of this brief, we have compiled data from 72 insurers across 13 states and the District of Columbia. (The 13 states reviewed include: Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington.) These filings are preliminary and may change during the review process. Rates will be finalized in late summer.",
            "In tracking these filings, we are looking at several factors that could drive costs in 2023, including health cost trend (which includes health sector inflation and changes in utilization), the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in federal policies (including the possible expiration of the American Rescue Plan Actsubsidies, the implementation of theNo Surprises Act, and the administrative fix to theFamily Glitch).",
            "We find that insurers in this market are proposing to raise premiums by more than inrecentyears. The median proposed premium increase is 10% across these 72 insurers. The main contributor to premium growth is health cost trend, which reflects rising prices paid to providers and pharmaceutical companies as well as a rebound in utilization. While our analysis focuses on the ACA markets, the main premium drivers we identified (prices and utilization) are systemic and not specific to the ACA markets.",
            "So far, we find that across 72 insurers in 13 states and the District of Columbia, the median proposed premium increase is about 10%. Most premium changes insurers are requesting for 2023 fall between about 5% and 14% percent (the 25thand 75thpercentile, respectively). Compared to recent years, relatively few insurers are requesting to lower their premiums, with only 4 out of 72 insurers filing negative premium changes, and the remaining 68 insurers requesting premium increases.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "As these rates are preliminary and we do not yet have data for every state, the actual average percent increase in premiums will not be known until early fall. It is also the case that the overall average increase in premiums is often different from the average increase in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for calculating subsidies for Marketplace enrollees.",
            "In these filings, insurers describe factors they expect will have either an upward or downward impact on their costs for the coming year. Across all 72 filings, we systematically tracked key words relating to medical trend, the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain policy changes (the expiration of American Rescue Plan Act subsidies, the implementation of the No Surprises Act, and the Family Glitch administrative fix). We also searched for other key words relating to current issues like telemedicine and mental health, but we found most insurers did not reference these subjects in their filings. Insurers do not always publicly quantify all factors driving their premiums.",
            "Every year, insurers are asked to project their health cost “trend,” which is a combination of rising prices paid to hospitals, doctors, and pharmaceutical companies (inflation) and upward or downward expectations for utilization (or, the number of visits, stays, or prescriptions).",
            "As is the case in most years, health cost trend is a key driver of premium growth in the coming year. For example, in their 2023 filings, many insurers are projecting a trend of about 4-8%.",
            "Although insurers are primarily interested in price growth in the health sector, given the unusually high pace of inflation in the rest of the economy, there is potential for generaleconomic inflationto flow through to the health sector. For example, Capital District Physicians Health Plan in New York warned of an imminent market correction, saying: “CPI for All goods and Services as of March 2022 was 8.5%, up 7% from pre-pandemic levels. Medical Care Services CPI in March 2020 (pre-pandemic) was 5.5% and as of March 2022 is 2.9%. This data suggests a correction is imminent as labor and supply cost increases directly impact hospitals and physician offices.”",
            "Over the course of the pandemic, most insurers in recent years have described how they expect the pandemic will shape their costs for the coming year. The pandemic can have both upward effects on health costs (such as through hospitalization and vaccine administration costs), as well as downward effects (such as through suppressed utilization). Amid the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, many insurers in2021and2022said they expected the pandemic would have a net neutral impact of 0% on their premiums, though some projected a slight negative or positive impact.",
            "For 2023, most Marketplace insurers mentioned the pandemic, and about half of the insurers we reviewed publicly quantified the pandemic’s effect on their premiums. As was the case in past years, some insurers said the pandemic would have a slight upward effect on rates while others said it would have a slight downward effect. Of the insurers that quantified the effect of the pandemic, most said it would have only a small impact on premiums (commonly plus or minus 1-2%).",
            "Several insurers noted that utilization of care is expected to rebound after having been suppressed during the early pandemic. For example, in Washington state, Regence Blue Cross Blue Shield “expects non‐COVID‐19 utilization and claims levels to return to trended pre‐pandemic levels.”",
            "Fidelis Care in New York “expects a significant decrease in costs associated with [COVID-19] treatment, but an increase in costs associated with vaccines and boosters.” They go on to say, “it is projected that insurers will be responsible for ingredients costs as well as increased billing due to fewer ‘mass vaccination’ programs.”",
            "Similarly, between the rollout of child vaccines and boosters for adults, Excellus Health Plan in New York expects 25% of the population to receive a vaccine or booster in 2023. Excellus also “expects to be liable for the ingredient cost in addition to the administration cost of the vaccine” with the expected lack of federal funding for vaccines.",
            "There are several federal policy changes that have the potential to affect premiums in 2023, including the expiration of the American Rescue Plan Act subsidies, the implementation of the No Surprises Act and the administrative fix to the Family Glitch.",
            "The most significant potential policy change is the expiration of the American Rescue Plan Act subsidies. These subsidies providedtemporary assistancefor ACA Marketplace enrollees to pay for their premiums, boosting the amount of the subsidy for those who were already eligible and expanding subsidy eligibility to millions of middle-income people, many of whom were previously priced out of the markets.",
            "Just under half of the insurers we reviewed quantified an effect of the expiration of ARPA subsidies on 2023 premiums. Of those insurers that publicly quantified an impact, about half said the expiration of ARPA would have a neutral impact, while the other half said it would have a slight upward impact on their costs (often no more than around 1%).",
            "For example, Excellus Health Plan in New York said the expiration of ARPA subsidies would have a nearly neutral impact on rates (0.2%), saying, “The population that is most likely to drop without these enhanced credits have better morbidity and substantially lower cost than those unlikely to move. This shift in the population would impact both expected claims and risk adjustment amounts.”",
            "In Michigan, Oscar Insurance Company said, “due to the uncertainty related to the potential extension of the expanded APTC subsidies, Oscar assumed they are due to expire at the end of 2022, which is expected to decrease market membership and subsequently increase market morbidity. The expiration of the subsidies has a premium impact of +1.7%. Should the subsidies be extended, it would decrease the rates by 1.7%.”",
            "Only a couple insurers mentioned the implementation of theNo Surprises Act, which prohibits most instances ofsurprise balance billingand only one insurer mentioned (though did not publicly quantify the impact of) the implementation of thefamily glitchfix. Of the two insurers that quantified the effect of the No Surprises Act, both said it would have a 0% impact on their premiums.",
            "After a few years of virtuallyflatpremiums in the ACA marketplaces, it appears 2023 rates may rise significantly. Although this brief is just an early look at preliminary rate filings, so far, the pattern emerging is that most insurers are requesting premium increases in the high single digits or low double digits.",
            "A substantial share of the increase in premiums is from rising health prices and utilization of health care, with the pandemic and policy changes having a relatively small impact on premiums. The rising prices and utilization insurers foresee in the ACA market are not necessarily specific to the ACA markets and therefore could affect premiums for employer-sponsored coverage as well.",
            "Although the COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on the U.S. health system and society more broadly, for the third straight year, many insurers are projecting the pandemic will have a net neutral or only slight impact on health costs and premiums.",
            "There are several federal policy changes that have the potential to impact premiums, particularly in the ACA markets. The most commonly mentioned by insurers is the potential expiration of American Rescue Plan Act subsidies. If these subsidies expire, out-of-pocket premium payments will rise sharply, which could cause some healthier enrollees to lose coverage. Some insurers said the expiration of these subsidies would have a slight upward effect on their premiums, but also said that if Congress extended the subsidies before rates are finalized, the insurers would reverse that increase. Congress is currently considering an extension of these subsidies, but it is unclear if they will act before 2023 premiums are locked in.",
            "Other policy changes are not having much of an effect on 2023 premiums. The Congressional Budget Office projected the No Surprises Act would have a slight downward effect on premiums of0.5% to 1%, however, both this year and last year, we find that insurers are generally refraining from attributing premium changes to the new law.",

            "Pregnancy is one of the most common reasons for a hospitalization among non-elderly people. In addition to the cost of the birth itself, pregnancy care also involves costs associated with prenatal visits and often includes care to treat psychological and medical conditions associated with pregnancy, birth, and the post-partum period.",
            "To examine the health costs associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care, we examined a subset of claims from the IBM MarketScan Encounter Database from 2018 through 2020 for enrollees in large employer private health plans. We look at health spending (both the amount paid by insurers and that paid out-of-pocket by enrollees) for female enrollees of reproductive age who give birth, compared to those who do not give birth, holding age constant.",
            "We find that health costs associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care average a total of $18,865 and the average out-of-pocket payments total $2,854 for women enrolled in large group plans. We also examine how pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum health spending among large group enrollees varies by the type of delivery, finding these costs for pregnancies resulting in a vaginal delivery average $14,768 ($2,655 of which is paid out-of-pocket) and those resulting in cesarean section (C-section) average $26,280 ($3,214 of which is paid out-of-pocket).",
            "Some previous analyses of the cost of pregnancy and childbirth have looked at the cost ofspecific services, such as vaginal and cesarean delivery, or services with a pregnancydiagnosis code. However, looking only at specific claims can miss other care associated with pregnancy and birth, such as psychological care, physical therapy, or treatment of other conditions that arise because of pregnancy but are not necessarily billed as a pregnancy related expense.",
            "In this analysis, we take a different approach. Using a regression model controlling for age, we look at the average difference in health spending for women of reproductive age who give birth compared to those of the same age who do not give birth. The benefit of this approach is that it allows us not only to look at the cost of the delivery, but also at all health costs associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "We limit the analysis to people who give birth in a hospital (either a live birth or stillborn) and do not include pregnancies that end in abortion or miscarriage. This analysis only includes the cost of the pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum recovery for the woman, and not any subsequent health spending for care of the infant.",
            "We estimate that pregnant women of reproductive age (ages 15 to 49) enrolled in large group health plans incur an average of $18,865 more in health care costs than women who do not give birth. This additional health spending associated with pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum care includes both the amount paid by insurance (an average of $16,011) and that paid out-of-pocket by the enrollee (an average of $2,854). There is significant variation around these averages, and costs vary significantly by the type of delivery.",
            "While pregnant women typically have frequent outpatient office visits prior to giving birth, most pregnancy-related health spending is for the delivery. Women in large group plans with a pregnancy incur an average of $19,906 more in inpatient and outpatient costs than women of the same age who do not give birth. But prescription drug spending averages $1,040lessfor women who give birth than for those who do not. Pregnant women are less likely to use prescription drugs than women of the same age who are not pregnant. Birth control pills (oral contraceptives) are one of the most used types of prescription drugs for women of reproductive age and some other prescription drugs areunsafeto take during pregnancy. However, these data only include spending on retail prescription drugs and therefore likely miss most out-of-pocket spending on prenatal vitamins or over-the-counter drugs that pregnant women may use.",
            "When looking at out-of-pocket costs over the course of a pregnancy, we find that pregnant women enrolled in large group health plans spend an average of $2,924 more on inpatient and outpatient care than women who are not pregnant spend out-of-pocket, while pregnant women spend an average of $70 less out-of-pocket on prescription drugs. In total, out-of-pocket costs are $2,854 higher for pregnant women than for those of the same age who do not give birth.",
            "These out-of-pocket costs only include amounts paid for cost-sharing (deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments) under the health plan. Therefore, out-of-pocket spending on fertility care is generally missed because these services are not often covered by insurance. Similarly, we do not include any balance bills sent by out-of-network providers directly to patients. Wepreviouslyestimated that 10% of in-network admissions for maternity care included an out-of-network charge putting patients at risk for surprise medical bills. However, as of January 2022, theNo Surprises Actprohibits surprise billing by out-of-network providers when a patient was admitted at an in-network hospital.",
            "Health costs associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care vary significantly based on whether the baby is born by cesarean section or vaginal delivery. Over the course of their pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum period, large group enrollees who give birth via cesarean section incur an average of $26,280 more in healthcare costs than those who do not give birth. By contrast, this amount for women with a vaginal delivery averages $14,768.",
            "The higher costs associated with pregnancies that result in cesarean section are not only because of the higher cost of the delivery, but also include higher costs before and after the birth, which may be associated with greater service intensity for care of complications or underlying health conditions that can lead to cesarean section and recovery from the surgery.",
            "Average out-of-pocket costs associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and post-partum care are also higher for women who deliver via cesarean section ($3,214) than for those with vaginal deliveries ($2,655). However, while the average total cost of a pregnancy resulting in a cesarean section ($26,280) is 77% higher than a pregnancy resulting in a vaginal delivery ($14,768), average out-of-pocket costs are 21% higher for women who give birth by cesarean section ($3,214) than those with a vaginal delivery ($2,655). This is largely because enrollees with an inpatient admission often hit their plans’ deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, so higher-cost hospitalizations do not always lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for the admission.",
            "The frequency and intensity of services associated with pregnancy and childbirth can lead to considerable out-of-pocket expenses for new parents, particularly those covered by private insurance.",
            "On average, over the course of their pregnancies, pregnant women enrolled in large employer health plans incur $2,854 more in out-of-pocket costs than similar women who are not pregnant. These costs are more than many families can afford. Roughly one third of multi-person households and half of single-person households would not have theliquid assetsneeded to cover typical out-of-pocket costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth in private health plans. Abouthalfof people who give birth in a given year are covered by private insurance, and the remainder are mostly covered by Medicaid, which generally has little or no out-of-pocket liability.",
            "Medical care for the infant can result in even more out-of-pocket costs for families with private insurance coverage. And these out-of-pocket health costs arrive just as these parents begin taking on additional costs of caring for a child. Many new parents also experience income losses due to a lack of paid parental leave, which can leave many newparentsvulnerable to incurringmedical debt.",
            "This analysis has some limitations, including that we do not control for health status before the pregnancy. It is possible women who give birth are somewhat healthier on average going into their pregnancies than women of the same age who do not give birth. Conversely, it is also possible that health conditions present before pregnancy may be incidentally discovered during pregnancy. Although we do not control for health status, health status and spending are strongly correlated with age, for which we do control.",
            "We are only including health spending that happens through the health plan, so do not include care that is paid fully out-of-pocket, which would include most fertility treatments (as this care is often not covered by insurance).",
            "We describe our findings as applying to pregnant women, though some of the births included were for female enrollees under the age of 18. The MarketScan sex variable is binary and our analysis is limited to the classification on the health record.",
            "This analysis uses claims from the IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by a sample of large employer plans. MarketScan allows for enrollees to be tracked for their duration at one contributing employer, and we used a subset of claims for enrollees covered in each of three years, 2018 through 2020. All dollar values are reported in 2020 nominal dollars. To make MarketScan data more representative of large group plans, weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",
            "We further limited the sample to female enrollees between ages 15 and 49 who were continuously enrolled during the 2018-2020 period, to avoid including costs for women who changed coverage during the pregnancy. In total, this analysis used claims for almost 2,267,200 female enrollees, which represents about 15% of the estimated 14,800,000 women of reproductive age enrolled in large group market plans (plans offered by employers with one thousand or more workers) in 2018.",
            "IBM assigns a DRG to each admission using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Grouper. This method selects a DRG for the admission based on the diagnosis and procedures a patient received during the stay. We identify women as having a pregnancy if, between August 2018 and September 2020, they had an admission that was designated as a delivery (783-788, 796-798 and 805-807). We then modeled spending for these enrollees between January 2018 and December 2020, controlling for age and whether they had multiple pregnancy related admissions over that period. This method does not include the cost of pregnancy for enrollees who do not give birth (i.e., those pregnancies ending in a miscarriage or abortion).",
            "Claims data available in MarketScan allows an analysis of liabilities incurred by enrollees with some limitations. First, these data reflect cost sharing incurred under the benefit plan and do not include balance-billing payments that beneficiaries may make to health care providers for out-of-network services or out-of-pocket payments for non-covered services, meaning that we may understate the costs associated with pregnancy. Secondly, claims data show the retail cost for prescription drugs and do not include information about the value of rebates that may be received by payers. Third, when showing how spending is divided across types of care (i.e., health services and prescriptions), we combine spending on inpatient and outpatient care because global billing is commonly used for maternity services. In claims data, inpatient costs will therefore sometimes include all services for routine prenatal care, delivery services, and postpartum care since the global maternity claim is typically billed the day of delivery. Lastly, sex is defined as reported on the claim, and we are unable to identify the gender identity of the enrollee.",

            "Health plans use cost-sharing (deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) as incentives for enrollees to use services efficiently and to shop for lower cost options when they do need care. Cost-sharing that is too high, however, can discourage enrollees fromgetting the carethat they need or drive them intofinancial distressand evenbankruptcy. Enrollees in private health insurance plans may have to pay thousands of dollars to meet plan deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. Cost-sharing in private health insurance plans has steadily increased over time. For employer-based coverage in 2021, theaverage deductiblesfor single coverage were $2,379 for covered workers at small firms and $1,397 for covered workers in larger firms. Similarly, deductibles in non-group Marketplace plans can bemuch higherfor enrollees not eligible for cost-sharing reductions.",
            "To evaluate whether people can afford to pay cost-sharing amounts common with private insurance plans, we analyzed data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). We estimate the share of households with enough savings to meet typical deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums in private health plans. Because cost-sharing requirements are higher in family plans than in single plans, we show results separately for single-person households and households with more than one person. We find that large shares of non-elderly households do not have enough liquid assets to meet typical plan cost-sharing amounts. For example, 45% of single-person non-elderly households could not pay over $2,000 from current liquid assets, and 63% could not pay over $6,000. Lower-income households were much less likely to have the liquid assets to meet typical cost sharing.",
            "The Survey of Consumer Finances provides a snapshot of household finances, including detailed information on debts, assets, income, and the types of health insurance present in the household. Many households have mixed insurance coverages, with members enrolled in different types of plans. This analysis focuses on non-elderly households, regardless of the types of coverages present. Based on an earlier KFFanalysis, we developed two measures of household resources:liquid financial assetsandnet financial assets. Generally, liquid financial assets are higher than net financial assets (which also reflect debt) and therefore for simplicity, we present liquid financial assets and report net financial assets in the Appendix.",
            "Liquid financial assets are those that are most easily converted to cash, including checking and saving accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, savings bonds, non-retirement mutual funds, stocks and bonds. It excludes the value of dedicated retirement accounts (such as 401k accounts) and the cash value of life insurance. We think of this as the money that a household could bring to bear in a short period.",
            "Among non-elderly households in 2019, median liquid assets were $2,977 for single-person non-elderly households and $6,704 for households with more than one person. That means that half of non-elderly people living on their own could contribute $2,977 or less from their liquid assets to cost-sharing and half of multi-person households could contribute $6,704 or less.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "Median assets vary tremendously with household income. Median liquid assets for single-person non-elderly households with incomes below 150% of poverty were $577, compared to $1,753 for those between 150% and 400% of poverty, and $13,243 for those above 400% of poverty. Median liquid assets among multi-person households were $698 in households below 150% of poverty compared to $2,996 for households between 150% and 400% of poverty, and $23,439 for households with incomes of 400% of poverty or more. For reference, a four-person household earning $103,000 would have an income at 400% of thefederal poverty levelin 2019.",
            "Another way to think about household assets is to look at the percent of households with enough liquid assets to meet different cost-sharing amounts. We focus on two thresholds of savings. The first threshold of $2,000 for single-person households (or $4,000 for multi-person households) represents the mid-range of typical deductibles for employer-based plans. The second threshold of $6,000 for single person households (or $12,000 for multi-person households) is in line with higher deductibles. About1 in 5workers in self-only employer-sponsored plans had an out-of-pocket maximum above $6,000, the threshold we use in this analysis.",
            "About half of households could not afford a typical employer plan deductible and almost two in three households do not have enough resources to cover a higher-end deductible of private health plans. 45% of single-person non-elderly households could not pay $2,000 from their liquid assets (the typical employer plan single deductible), and 62% could not pay $6,000 (a very high single deductible). Among multi-person households, 42% could not pay $4,000 from their liquid assets (the typical employer plan family deductible), and 61% could pay $12,000 (a very high family deductible).",
            "The Affordable Care Act limits out-of-pocket maximums in most private health plans ($8,700 for single coverage and $17,400 for family coverage in 2022), but many plans set lower out-of-pocket maximums. The average out-of-pocket maximum for single coverage was $4,272 in 2021.",
            "Most households do not have enough liquid assets to meet the typical out-of-pocket maximum. In a given year, most people are relatively healthy and would not need to pay these expenses, but a serious illness or accident could potentially expose people to high costs.",
            "Lower-income people are less able to afford costly medical care. Among non-elderly people living on their own with incomes below 150% of poverty, 72% could not pay $2,000 from their liquid assets for cost sharing, compared with 54% of those between 150% and 400% of poverty and only 16% of those above 400% of poverty or more.",
            "Low-wage individuals may have reduced cost-sharing if they are covered through Medicaid or a Marketplace plan, but many areineligiblefor these programs. Low-wage workers enrolled in employer plans may struggle to meet plan cost-sharing requirements. Approximately 84% of multi-person households with incomes below 150% of the FPL do not have $4,000 in liquid assets, in addition to 16% of households with incomes above 400% of the FPL and 57% of households in between. While households with higher incomes are more likely to have savings, many still do not have enough to meet typical cost-sharing level, evidenced by the fact that approximately one-in-six multi-person households earning above 400% of poverty have less than $4,000 in liquid assets.",
            "Only 6% of multi-person non-elderly households with incomes below 150% of poverty, 20% with incomes between 150% and 400% of poverty, and 65% with incomes of 400% of poverty or more could pay $12,000 from liquid assets. People with incomes under 138% of poverty are eligible for Medicaid (which typically has little to no cost sharing) if their state expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act.",
            "Affordability also varies based on insurance status and coverage type. Households with someone who is uninsured have particularly low levels of assets. Among single-person non-elderly households without insurance, only 37% could cover a $2,000 expense from liquid assets, and just 18% could pay $6,000. Among multi-person households with at least one uninsured member, 70% could not pay $4,000 from liquid assets and 86% could not pay $12,000.",
            "Generally, households where someone has private insurance have higher assets however, a significant share still do not have resources to meet typical cost-sharing expenses. For example, about a third (32%) of single-person households with private insurance in 2019 could not pay a $2,000 bill, and half (51%) could not pay a $6,000 bill. Among multi-person non-elderly households in which at least one person is covered by a private insurance plan, 31% do not have more than $4,000 in liquid assets. This indicates that nearly a third of these households could not pay cost-sharing amounts beyond these amounts with their liquid assets.",
            "When faced with high medical bills, people may turn to friends and relatives for help. Approximately two-thirds of non-elderly households indicated that, in an emergency, they could obtain $3,000 of financial assistance from friends or relatives. Households with higher incomes are more likely to say this is possible – 80% of households with incomes over 400% of the FPL say they could rely on personal networks to obtain $3,000, compared with 62% of households with incomes between 150% and 400% of the poverty level.",
            "KFF’sprevious analysison the subject found that even relatively small medical expenses can lead to persistent debt. The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) is an annual survey conducted by the Federal Reserve that asks individuals about their income and how they think about household finances. The 2020 SHED asked respondents how they would cover an emergency expense of $400. A significant share of non-elderly adults enrolled in an employer or non-group health plan indicated that they would not be able to meet this amount from their current savings, including 16% who indicated they would put a $400 emergency expense on their credit card and pay it off over time, 2% who reported that they would take a bank loan and 6% said they would be unable to meet the expenses.",
            "KFFpreviously collaborated with the Los Angeles Timesto field a national survey concerning the experiences of adults with employer-sponsored health insurance. A significant share of respondents reported affordability challenges, including four in ten (40%) who said that their family had problems paying for medical bills or affording premiums. These challenges were more pronounced among lower-income households. Sixty-five percent of people in households earning less than $40,000, and 51% of people in households with incomes between $40,000 and $75,000, indicated that they found it difficult to afford premiums or care, despite employer-sponsored coverage.",
            "Over half of survey respondents (51%) on an employer plan reported that someone in their household skipped or postponed care or filling a prescription in the past year because of the expense, and 17% said they have had to make difficult sacrifices to pay health costs. During the last year, 26% of adults on an employer plan reported cutting spending on food, clothing, and household items to pay for health-related expenses, and 20% said that they took on additional credit card debt.",
            "By shifting a portion of health cost onto people using services, health plan cost-sharing reduces the expense paid by the insurer, thereby potentially lowering the premium. More importantly, requiring consumers to contribute encourages them to carefully consider which services they will use, and, depending on how the cost-sharing is structured, may encourage the use of lower-cost care. While cost-sharing may reduce premiums, evidence suggests it also mightdiscourage people from seekingneeded and beneficial care.",
            "As cost-sharing levels have increased, so has concern about cost-related access barriers among people with private coverage. While low-income people enrolled in Medicaid or the Marketplaces face little or no cost-sharing, employer plans generally do not vary cost-sharing based on income. In 2020, just 7% of firms with 50 or more workers hadprograms to help lower-wage workersmeet cost-sharing obligations.",
            "Much of the discussion around affordability of private coverage has centered on premium costs. A broader notion of affordability would focus on the ability of families, particularly low- and middle-income families, to meet potentially high out-of-pocket expenses associated with a chronic or acute illness. In addition to high cost sharing deterring needed health care, it can also create financial instability. In the U.S., nearly 1 in 10 adults owemedical debt.",
            "The 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is a triennial, nationally representative household survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. The survey has adual frame, with respondents selected from both a national area probability design and a sample of households with high-income tax returns. The poverty levels are defined as $12,490 for a single-person household and $4,420 for every additional person in the household, and are based on the 2019 Poverty Guidelines as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services. The2019 SCFis based on about 4,100 non-elderly households. Weights were applied to ensure that percentages were representative of the population.",
            "The SCF defines a family as a “primary economic unit (PEU),” or all the individuals living in a household who are financially interdependent with the dominant individual or couple. Income and assets are measured for the PEU in the household. The definitions of the different types of assets and debts are availablehere. In this analysis, we first look at the median levels of assets of non-elderly households. We look at median assets because the averages are significantly affected by a small number of households with high levels of assets",
            "The SCF provides information about the types of insurance present in each household, and about whether each member had coverage or not. Unlike financial characteristics, insurance questions are asked of all members of a household, including members that are not part of the PEU, which could be a relative who is financially independent or a financially independent non-relative living in the household. This creates some potential ambiguity when we look at households in which someone has private coverage because it is possible that the only people with private coverage are not part of the PEU. Because we have information, about whether or not each person in the household has some coverage or not, we were better able to target the members of the PEU in identifying households where someone was uninsured. We selected only households where the financially dominant individual, his or her spouse or partner, or his or her financially dependent children (regardless of the child’s age) were uninsured. Many households have multiple forms of coverage.",
            "The Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) is an annual survey of adults conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. The survey is based on the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative probability-based online panel. Ipsos selected respondents for KnowledgePanel based on address-based sampling (ABS). The questions asked of the panel are intended to gather information from the individual about how they make household economic decisions. The SHED survey finishes data collection in October and then releases the report and public use file in May of the following year.",
            "The Survey of Consumer Finances provides a snapshot of household finances, including detailed information on households’ debts, assets, income and the types of health insurance present in the household. Based on an earlier KFFanalysis, we developed two measures of household resources:liquid financial assetsandnet financial assets. Both measures are conservative, since they assume a household can use all of their savings to pay one year’s cost-sharing total. This would leave a household with no additional assets to meet other non-health emergencies or health expenses in the following year. Generally, liquid financial assets are higher than net financial assets (which also reflect debt) and therefore, for simplicity, we presented the analysis using liquid financial assets, and included information on net financial assets in this appendix.",
            "Net financial assets, is a broader measure of the household’s total resources. This category includes all financial assets (including assets dedicated to retirement) reduced by the household’s unsecured debts. For this measure, the value of assets is reduced by credit-card debt and other unsecured loans, but debts secured by real property (such as mortgage debt) and loans for vehicles and education are not counted against assets. This category measures how much money a household has available to pay medical expenses after meeting some debt obligations, although the money may not be easily accessible in all cases.",

            "More than three in four adults in the United States think the costs of prescription drugs areunaffordableand nearly one in three adults say they haven’t taken their medications as prescribed due to costs. In 2019, the U.S. spent more than $1,000 per person on prescribed medicines, an amount higher than any peer nation.",
            "This chart collection examines what we know about prescription drug spending and use in the U.S. and comparably large and wealthy countries, using data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).",
            "In 2019 (the latest year with internationally comparable data from the OECD), the U.S. spent $1,126 per capita on prescribed medicines, while comparable countries spent $552 on average. This includes spending from insurers and out-of-pocket costs from patients for prescription drugs filled at the pharmacy.",
            "Per capita prescribed medicine spending in the U.S. grew by 69% from 2004 to 2019, compared to 41% in comparable countries, on average. During this period growth rates fluctuated, with modest growth in U.S. from 2006 to 2013, and sharp increases in growth in 2014 and 2015 which were largelydrivenby the introduction of new, highly priced treatments.",
            "In the U.S., per capita insurer payments and out-of-pocket spending on prescribed medicines ($963 and $164, respectively in 2019) are both higher than in any other comparable country. Private and public insurance programs cover a similar share of prescription medicine spending in the U.S. compared to peer nations, on average (85% and 84%, respectively). However, the steep costs in the U.S. still contribute to high U.S. healthcare spending and are passed onto Americans in the form of higher premiums and taxpayer-funded public programs. Given that retail drugs account for18% oftotal health spending in employer plans, changes in prices or use of drugs can impact employer costs, employee premiums, and patient costs.",
            "The prices of many brand-nameprescription drugsused to treat conditions including diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and cardiovascular disease are more expensive in the U.S. than in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland or the U.K. For instance, the price of Humira in the U.S. is 423% more expensive that the price in the U.K. and 186% more than that in Germany.",
            "Countries’ prescription drug policies can vary based on a number offactors, including the regulation or benchmarking of prescription drugprices, the numbers of and types of payers, the role of pharmaceutical benefit managers, patent protections of drugs, and the availability and prices of generic or biosimilar alternatives. In the U.S., drugs with no competitors can be moreexpensivethan in other countries, in part because the U.S. does not directly regulate or negotiate the price of drugs. When generics or biosimilars become available, these lower-cost alternatives canofferless expensive treatment options to patients and payers.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "Substituting generics for brand name drugs can reduce health care spending. International comparisons of the share of the prescription drug market that is made up of generic drugs are a challenge due to differences in data collection. While most countries, including the United States, categorize the “share of dispensed prescriptions” attributable to generics by the number of prescriptions, some comparable countries use daily doses. Nevertheless, this data provides an insight into the use of generics and relative spending. The data shows that while a vast majority (90%) of dispensed prescriptions in the U.S. are for generic drugs, spending on these drugs represents a smaller fraction of spending (19.8%). While prices of brand-name drugs have generally increased, prices of generics have largelygone down.",
            "Both price and use affect the cost of any good or service, and the same holds for prescription drugs. Data on the use of prescription drugs can be hard to capture and compare across countries. Available survey data finds that over half of people in the U.S. (58%) report taking prescription drugs on a regular or on-going basis, which is similar to the share in comparable countries (51% on average).",
            "However, this data is limited because it does not capture the average dose of prescription medication in the U.S. compared to peer nations. The available data suggest that differences in the number of people taking medication or the number of prescriptions may not fully account for high spending on prescription drugs.",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthspendingandutilizationtrends in the United States, though it is not yet clear how long that disruption will last. In April 2020, health spending droppedprecipitouslyas providers cancelled elective care and patients practicing social distancing avoided health facilities. Utilization of health services has remained somewhatlower than expectedbased on utilization levels in years before the pandemic. Thus far into the year, we have not seen pent-up demand from delayed or forgone care in the last year. The effects of this delayed and forgone care on health spending and outcomes are yet to be seen. As a result of lagging vaccinations and the more infectious delta variant, COVID-19hospitalizationsanddeaths, the overwhelming majority of which are among unvaccinated people, increased over the summer. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may introduce more uncertainty on future health costs.",
            "The U.S. Census Bureau’s Quarterly Services Survey (QSS) data show seasonally adjusted health services revenue in the second quarter of 2021 remained below projected levels. Projected revenues were estimated based on 2018 second quarter to 2019 second quarter revenue growth rate applied to the 2019 second quarter forward to 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, actual laboratory services revenue was somewhat above expectations based on pre-pandemic spending, likely due to increased use of COVID-19 testing services. However, for physician services, outpatient care centers, and hospitals, spending in the second quarter of 2021 remained below expected based on pre-pandemic spending.",
            "While uncertainty around the pandemic’s effect on health spending remains, health insurance actuaries have access to the latest health utilization and spending data and can use these data to model future trends. Reviewing health insurer premium calculations for the coming year can give us a glimpse into how the pandemic may or may not affect health spending and utilization in the future.",
            "Insurers planning to offer health plans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces must submit filings to state or federal regulators detailing their plan offerings and justifying their premiums for the upcoming year. Rates are finalized in early fall (October 15, 2021) ahead of the annual open enrollment period, set to begin on November 1, 2021.",
            "In this brief, we reviewed final 2022 premium rate filings for Marketplace-participating individual market insurers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although the Affordable Care Act (ACA) individual market represents a small share of the privately insured population, the rate filings for this market are detailed and publicly accessible, making them a useful source of information on how health insurers are thinking about their likely costs for the next year. We also reviewed rate filings for the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), whichexpanded subsidiesavailable in the ACA health insurance Marketplaces, on 2022 average costs in the individual market.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "We reviewed rate filings for an overall 2022 average premium increase across Marketplace-participating individual market plans, with a focus on the effect of the pandemic on average rate changes. Of the 311 rate filings reviewed, 272 plans had a publicly available premium change for 2022. A majority of rate changes for 2022 are moderate, with most insurers posting premium increases or decreases of a few percentage points. Rate changes from 2021 to 2022 range from a -28.5% decrease to a 25.6% increase, though half fell between a -1.8% decrease and 6.2% increase. All insurer rates are shown in the Appendix.",
            "Of the 311 insurer rate filings we reviewed across all states and D.C., 91 (29%) quantified a COVID-19 impact on rates in their filings, and 50 filings (16%) quantified an impact of ARPA expanded subsidies on 2022 rates. Some of the insurers that mentioned an impact of COVID-19 or ARPA on their 2022 costs did not specify the factor or redacted the amount.",
            "Among the 91 insurers that quantified an impact of COVID-19 on their 2022 costs, the impact of COVID-19 on 2022 individual market costs ranged from -2.6% to 8.4% with half of insurers falling between no impact and 1.0% increase.",
            "Of the 50 insurers that quantified an effect of the ARPA on 2022 costs, 29 expect the ARPA to have a downward impact on costs (-5% to -0.2%), one estimated a positive impact (0.6%), and 20 estimated no impact on costs (0.0%). Most insurers do not expect the ARPA to affect their 2022 costs and a few insurers expect ARPA expanded subsidies to decrease the average morbidity of enrollees in the individual market.",
            "Most Marketplace-participating insurers expect their costs to return to normal and therefore say the COVID-19 pandemic will not be a factor in their 2022 premiums. Insurers are generally expecting utilization to return to pre-pandemic trends. ACA Marketplaceenrollmentincreased by 15% from 2020 to 2021 following the American Rescue Plan Act, which expanded subsidies in the ACA Marketplaces for 2021 and 2022, and the special enrollment period. A few insurers predict these new enrollees may be healthier and lower risk than current members, though most plans did not quantify the impact of the American Rescue Plan Act on costs in 2022.",
            "While insurers utilize comprehensive data to project future changes in health spending and utilization, their projections remain speculative, especially in the context of the pandemic. Uncertainties remain on how new COVID-19 variants, the plateauing uptake of vaccinations, and potential pent-up demand from delayed care might affect costs in the future.",
            "Data were collected from health insurer rate filings submitted to state regulators. Most rate information is available in SERFF filings (System for Election Rate and Form Filing) that includes a base rate and other factors that build up to an individual rate. All other filings were found either on the state insurer’s website or on ratereview.healthcare.gov. This analysis only includes rate filings that were made public on or before October 15, 2021.",
            "The impact of ARPA or COVID-19 factors on 2022 costs was categorized as “does not mention” if the actuarial memorandum was heavily redacted, if COVID-19 was mentioned in the context of cost normalizations to pre-pandemic levels, or if those factors were not referenced. The impact of ARPA or COVID-19 factors on 2022 costs was categorized as “not specified” if the insurer made reference to an impact but did not specify the amount.",

            "Note: An updated version of this analysis ishere.",
            "COVID-19 was thethird leading cause of deathacross most of 2020, but in December 2020 and early 2021, the illness surged and briefly became thenumber oneleading cause of death in the U.S., far surpassing even cancer and heart disease deaths in those months.",
            "With the rapid uptake in vaccinations in the months when vaccines first became widely available, COVID-19 deaths fell sharply. COVID-19 dropped to the number 8 leading cause of death in the U.S. in July 2021.",
            "However, with the more infectious COVID-19 Delta variant and insufficient vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases,hospitalizations, and deaths areincreasingagain. Vaccination rates are particularly lagging foryounger adultsand people living in certainstates. As of August 25, 2021, about73% of adults(ages 18+) in the U.S. have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.",
            "This brief revisits where deaths from COVID-19 rank among leading causes of death in the U.S. and finds that COVID-19 is again the third leading cause of death in August 2021. We also assess age-specific rank of COVID-19 among leading causes of death in the U.S. and find COVID-19 continues to be a leading cause of death for all ages.",

            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "COVID-19 briefly dropped to the number 8 leading cause of death in July 2021. Looking at the most recent data available on deaths fromCOVID-19andothercauses, we estimate that COVID-19 is currently the number 3 leading cause of death in the U.S. in August 2021. COVID-19 deaths in the chart above represent the average daily deaths through August 24, 2021. Average daily deaths from accidents and suicides are from 2020. Deaths from other causes represent the daily average deaths from January through June of this year.",
            "In August 2021, an average of more than 700 people per day continue to die of COVID-19 in the U.S., even as safe and effective vaccines have been free and widely available to adults in all states and D.C. since early May 2021. Nearly all COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have been amongunvaccinatedpeople.",
            "The number of daily deaths from COVID-19 had decreased remarkably from the once staggering 3,066 deaths per day in January 2021 but has started increasing since August 2021. Heart disease, which is typically the number one cause of death in the U.S. each year, leads to the death of about 2,000 Americans per day, and cancer claims about 1,600 American lives per day.",
            "The cumulative count ofdeathsattributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. is 630,868 from the start of the pandemic through August 25, 2021.",
            "The chart above combines data on COVID-19 mortality rates fromKFF’s trackerwith data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) onweekly countsof death by jurisdiction and cause of death andmonthly provisionalcounts of deaths by select causes. Deaths from COVID-19 and other causes in the chart above are the average daily deaths in each month of 2020 and 2021. During most of 2020, COVID-19 was one of the top three leading causes of death. As vaccinations increased, average daily deaths from COVID-19 decreased since the peak in January 2021 but have been increasing again recently. COVID-19 rank among leading causes fell to number 8 in July 2021 but is back to number 3 again in August 2021.",
            "To rank COVID-19 among other leading causes of death by age groups, we looked atCOVID-19deaths in each month of 2021 and the most recent available data for other rankable age-specific leading causes, including congenital disorders and perinatal conditions that mostly affect children.",
            "COVID-19 is among the top 10 leading causes of death across ages 15 years and older even in June 2021. In June 2021, COVID-19 ranked number 7 above diabetes for ages 15-24 years, number 6 above liver disease for ages 25-34 years, number 5 above homicide for ages 35-44, number 4 above liver disease for ages 45-54 years, number 4 above chronic lower respiratory disease for ages 55-64 years, number 5 above diabetes for ages 65-74, and number 7 above accidents for ages 75-84, and number 7 above diabetes for ages over 85 years.",
            "Even among children ages 5-14 COVID-19 was in the top 10 leading causes of death through May 2021, and ranked number 12 in June 2021 above perinatal conditions. Among children ages 1-4, COVID-19 ranked as high as number 7 among leading causes in April 2021.",
            "Due to data reporting lags, age-specific COVID-19 death data are not available for July and August 2021. With the rise in COVID-19 deaths due to the Delta variant in August 2021, COVID-19 ranking likely increased for some age groups during August 2021.",
            "We used theKFF COVID-19 Trackerdata for average daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the United States. August 2021 average deaths from COVID-19 are averaged through August 24, 2021. For data on deaths due to other leading causes, we usedmonthly provisionalcounts of death by select causes, 2020-2021.  For other leading causes, we used CDC data forweekly countsof death by select underlying causes of death. For other leading causes from the weekly counts CDC file, only MMWR weeks 1-25 are included in average daily deaths for 2021. The average daily deaths for accidents and suicides are from 2020. Heart disease deaths were combined for all circulatory disease except stroke. Stroke represents cerebrovascular disease. In the second chart, respiratory disease represents chronic lower respiratory disease and the 2020 average daily deaths for accidents are reported.",
            "For age-specific rank of COVID-19 deaths among other leading causes of death, we used CDC provisional COVID-19 deaths databy agefor January – June 2021 (as of August 18, 2021) and CDC provisional death counts for other leadingcauses. Infants were excluded from this analysis as the 15thleading cause of death based on 2019 CDC Wonder data had a monthly average greater than the highest COVID-19 death count for this age group in any given month in 2021.  For age-specific leading causes for which 2021 monthly provisional death counts were not available, we usedCDC Wonderdata for 2019 for age-specific average monthly death counts.",

            "Federal lawrequiresall private insurance plans to cover the entire cost associated with approved COVID-19testingso long as the test is deemed medically appropriate. Additionally, the U.S. government pre-paid for COVID-19 vaccines and required COVID-19vaccinesbe made available at no out-of-pocket costs regardless of whether the vaccine recipient is insured. However, while a handful of states required or created agreements with insurers towaiveCOVID-19 out-of-pockettreatmentcosts for their fully-insured plan enrollees, there is no federal mandate requiring insurers to do so.",
            "Earlier in the pandemic,we foundthat the vast majority (88%) of people enrolled in fully-insured private health plans nonetheless would have had their out-of-pocket costs waived if they were hospitalized with COVID-19. At the time, health insurers were highly profitable due to lower-than-expected health care use, while hospitals and health care workers were overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. Insurers may have also wanted to be sympathetic toward COVID-19 patients, and some may have also feared the possibility of a federal mandate to provide care free-of-charge to COVID-19 patients, so they voluntarily waived these costs for at least some period of time during the pandemic. Our subsequentanalysisfound that several of these insurers were starting to phase out COVID-19 cost-sharing waivers by November 2020.",
            "In the last few months, the environment has shifted with safe and highly effective vaccines now widely available. In this brief, we once again review how many private insurers are continuing to waive patient cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment. We find that 72% of the two largest insurers in each state and DC (102 health plans) are no longer waiving these costs, and another 10% of plans are phasing out waivers by the end of October.",
            "Across the two largest health plans in each state and D.C. (102 plans), 73 plans (72% of 102 plans) are no longer waiving out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 treatment. Almost half these plans (50 plans) ended cost-sharing waivers by April 2021, which is around the time most states were opening vaccinations to all adults. Of the 29 plans still waiving cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment, 10 waivers are set to expire by the end of October. This includes waivers that tie to the end of the federal Public Health Emergency, which is currently set to expire on October 17, 2021, though may be extended. Another 12 plans state that their cost-sharing waivers will expire by the end of 2021. Two plans specified end dates for COVID-19 treatment waivers in 2022 and 5 plans did not specify an expiration date.",
            "All of the 102 plans we reviewed (two largest plans in each state) had waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment at some point since 2020. (These health plans represent 62% of enrollment across the fully insured individual and group markets).",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Many employers offering self-funded and fully insured health plans to their employees also reported waiving COVID-19 treatment cost sharing based on preliminary results from the 2021 KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey (EHBS), which was fielded between January and July 2021 with over 70% of the interviews completed before April 19thwhen vaccines became available for most adults. Since this survey was conducted earlier in the year, many of the waivers may have already expired by the time of this report.",
            "Based on preliminary results from the 2021 EHBS, 36% of firms (with 50 or more employees) reported that their largest plan waived cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment at the time of the survey. Larger firms with 1,000 or more workers were more likely to waive COVID-19 treatment cost-sharing for enrollees than smaller employers.",
            "This survey includes both self-funded employers and those buying fully insured coverage. Before this survey, there was no way to know whether self-funded employers were also waiving these costs as the decision was not up to the insurer administering the plan. In the survey, we see that self-funded employers were similarly likely as employers purchasing fully-insured plans to offer waivers for COVID-19 cost sharing.",
            "Motivated by high profits, ACAmedical loss ratiorebate requirements, public health concerns about managing the pandemic, and concern over a federal mandate to cover COVID-19 treatment costs, many insurers offered financial relief to their enrollees amid the coronavirus pandemic, primarily through waived COVID-19 treatment costs and less commonly through premium credits or reductions.",
            "Earlier in the pandemic, relatively few COVID-19 patients would have been billed for their hospitalization because of the voluntary waivers extended by private insurers and employers. But as vaccines have become widely available to adults in the U.S. and health care utilization has rebounded more generally, health insurers may no longer face political or public relations pressure to continue waiving costs for COVID-19 treatment. As more waivers expire, more people hospitalized for COVID-19 – the vast majority of whom areunvaccinated– will likely receive significant medical bills for their treatment.",
            "The typical deductible in employer health plans is$1,644, and our earlier analysis found that large group enrollees hospitalized with pneumonia (requiring similar treatment to those hospitalized with COVID-19) paid an average of over$1,300out-of-pocket. Although this is a large amount to most patients, and could be an incentive to get vaccinated, it still only represents afractionof the cost born to society for these largely preventable hospitalizations. Unvaccinated COVID-19 hospitalizations cost the U.S. health system$2.3 billionin June and July 2021.",
            "We used the 2019 Mark Farrah HHS MLR Reporting data to identify the top two plans with the largest combined individual and fully-insured plan enrollment in each state and D.C. We systematically reviewed whether each of the 102 plan provided cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 treatment and when the waivers expired using each insurer’s COVID-19 resources webpage and relevant press releases.",
            "Many insurers referenced “treatment” broadly in context of cost-sharing waivers. However, there were instances when the form of treatment was specified. We used the cost-sharing waiver expiration date for hospitalizations and emergency room visits when the insurer reported different cost-sharing waiver expiration dates for antibody treatment and for hospitalizations and emergency room visits. If the information could not be located on the plan’s website, we pulled information from the insurer’s parent company’s website and made phone calls to insurers when necessary.",
            "In instances where we could not locate information from insurer or parent company websites, we deferred to the America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the trade association representing private insurers,summarythat was last updated as of April 8, 2021. If a date of expiration was unavailable for insurers that said they were waiving treatment costs, we categorized the plans as “not specified.”",
            "The annual KFF Employer Health Benefits Survey (EHBS) for 2021 was conducted between January and July of 2021 and included almost 1,700 randomly selected, non-federal public and private firms with three or more employees. The methods for the 2021 EHBS are similar to those used in2020. In 2021, we asked firms if they currently waived cost-sharing for treating enrollees who become infected with COVID-19. A full description of the 2021 methods, finalized data, and findings on other topics such as health insurance premiums and firm offer rates will be released in the fall of 2021. The results described above are preliminary.",

            "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, stay-at-home measures, potential risk of COVID infection at a hospital or doctors’ offices, and concerns over hospital capacity led to sharp declines in health careutilizationandspending, includingdropsin hospital admissions for both acute and elective procedures. There was also a drop inpreventiveservice use. Spendingdecreasedacross all health services. Whiletelemedicine useincreased rapidly during the pandemic, it did not offset the decrease in in-person care.",
            "Many have wondered whether health care utilization will rebound or even increase to make up for the delayed or forgone care from the past year. If so, this pent-up demand has the potential to increase health spending now or in the coming year.",
            "This briefupdatesEpic Health Research Network (EHRN) and KFF analysis of data for nearly 10 million admissions in the Epic health record system. Data come from Cosmos, a HIPAA Limited Data Set from Epic customers, which include 250 hospitals across 47 states and 112 million patients. We also used Bureau of Economic Analysis data to look at trends in health services spending. We find that hospital admissions remain below expected levels through early April 2021. Similarly, health spending overall (for hospitals and ambulatory care) remains below expected levels through at least June 2021. Thus far into the pandemic, we have not seen an increase in hospital admissions due to pent-up demand for forgone care in the last year.",
            "The Epic Health Research Network (EHRN) data show hospital admissions remaining below expected levels through at least April 9, 2021. In the week beginning on April 3, 2021, hospital admissions were 85.5% of what would be expected based on historic patterns. Averaged over the first quarter of 2021, hospital admission rates were 89.4% of what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic.",
            "Though vaccinations significantly reduced the rates of hospitalizations for COVID-19 in early April 2021 from peak COVID hospitalizations in January 2021, the pandemic is still driving a significant share of hospital admissions. If we remove patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis, we see that all other admissions are 80.7% of expected levels based on pre-pandemic usage in the week of April 3, 2021.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "The hospital admissions data in this analysis are only through April 9, 2021. In recent weeks,COVID-19 hospitalizationshave begun to trend upward again in part due to the Delta variant. There remains uncertainty about how any future waves of COVID-19 cases might affect hospital utilization more generally.",
            "Reflecting lower utilization levels, health spending more broadly also remains below pre-pandemic levels. One source for health spending trends is the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data published monthly from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). PCE measures the total money spent on health services. Consistent with EHRN, PCE data show spending on health services (hospitals and ambulatory care) remains 7.1% below expected health spending in June 2021 on an annualized seasonally adjusted basis. Spending on hospitals is 4.1% below expected health spending in June 2021. Since January 2021, annualized overall health services and hospital expenditures are growing at a similar rate as prior to the pandemic in 2017-2020.",
            "While lower levels of utilization have reduced spending, hospitals and other health care providers have qualified for various types offederal assistanceduring the coronavirus pandemic. Most notably, hospitals and other health care providers received grants from the $178 billionprovider relief fundthat is being distributed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Thus, hospitals and providers may be temporarily sustained with the federal assistance. In the long-run once federal assistance dries up, depressed utilization could affect the finances of hospitals and other providers.",
            "Health insurers, in contrast, may be benefiting financially from this decline in hospital admissions and certain other medical services since the start of the pandemic. KFF analysis found that in 2020 averagegross marginsfor health insurers had remained relatively high compared to 2019 and 2018 across the individual market, group market, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed Care markets. In the fully-insured commercial market, the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to return some excess profits to enrollees in the form of rebates.",
            "Following an unprecedented decrease in the number of hospital admissions last year, utilization remains below expected levels. The persistence of lower-than-expected utilization suggests some of the care that did not occur early in the COVID-19 pandemic was foregone rather than simply delayed.",
            "Several factors may be contributing to the lower-than-expected number of hospital admissions in early 2021. For example, the economic effects of the pandemic may depress the number of people seeking services. As has been seen in past economic downturns, some people may be forgoing care due tocost reasons.",
            "Suppressed health care use may not be driven only by demand. A more limited supply of health care workers may also lead to continued delays in the availability of care. Health sector employmentdeclinedsomewhat in the pandemic, and even as health employment rebounds, it may take time for appointment slots to fully reopen.",
            "Even after the pandemic ends, the effects of this delayed and forgone care are yet to be seen.  Some of the care that was missed earlier in the pandemic may have been for acute conditions that resolved on their own or chronic conditions that were managed with less service intensity than would have otherwise been delivered. But in other cases, care that was missed may have led to worsened outcomes or even premature death. Looking ahead, people’s experiences with the health care system during the pandemic and increase in telemedicine and alternative ways of delivering care may alter how people use care.",
            "The analysis is based on EHRN and KFF analysis of the Epic Cosmos Limited Data Set, which includes data for more than 112 million patients from 250 hospitals across 47 states. Contributing organizations were included if they had data through January 1, 2017. Organizations were then excluded if they had go-lives or mergers during the study time period, had multiple weeks of missing data, or showed discrepancies.",
            "Overall, 9.6 million admissions are included in this sample. Expected admissions are based on the historic utilization in the pre-pandemic era. A generalized additive model was trained on weekly admissions data from January 1, 2017 to January 25, 2020 and to generate weekly predicted admissions from January 26, 2020 to April 9, 2021.",
            "Admissions were grouped by week of discharge. COVID-19 admissions are defined as admissions with either a documented COVID-19 diagnosis (U07.01) or other respiratory diagnosis involving a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 diagnosis within 14 days of admission.",
            "The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data through June 2021 published on July 30, 2021 were used. We used spending data for health services, which does not include spending on pharmaceutical and other medical products. The BEA monthly figures are estimates and are later adjusted using the Quarterly Services Survey. Therefore, there may be some lag in actual spending and monthly BEA estimates of health spending.",

            "As of January 1 of this year, hospitals are required to post prices of common health services on their websites via consumer-friendly tools for patient use. Prior to implementation of this rule, hospitals were only required to publish their gross, undiscounted charges for services, which are rarely what patients or insurers actually pay. Under the hospital price transparency rule finalized by the Trump Administration, hospitals must also publish payer-negotiated rates and the cost of discounted care for uninsured patients – though many hospitals are currentlynoncompliant.",
            "An objective ofthis price transparency rule is to allow patients to compare prices across hospitals and “shop” for lower-priced care. However, a recentKFF Health Tracking Pollfinds the vast majority of adults are unaware or say this requirement does not exist. Seven in ten (69%) say they are unsure whether hospitals are required to disclose the prices of treatments and procedures and an additional one in five (22%) say hospitals are not required to disclose this information. About one in ten (9%) are aware hospitals are required to disclose the prices of treatments and procedures on their websites.",
            "The low level of awareness of this newly adopted federal requirement is consistent across different age groups, income levels, and health status. Even among people with chronic conditions, who would be more likely to need hospital care, the majority either are unaware of hospital price transparency requirements or think that they do not exist.",
            "When asked whether they or a family member had gone online to research the price of a treatment at a hospital, the majority of adults (85%) said they had not. This finding is consistent withprior researchshowing that few adults shop for best-priced care. Among other reasons, many families do not have a need for hospital care in any given year, so might not be expected to look for prices.",
            "Fourteen percent of adults reported that they or a family member went online in the past six months to research the price of a treatment at a hospital, with differences in age groups, income, and party identification. Younger adults (ages 18-29 and those between 30-49 years old) were more likely to say they or a family member had searched for the price of care online (23% and 16%, respectively) than older adults ages 50-64 (10%) and 65 and older (9%). Adults with higher household incomes (between $40,000-$89,999 and those at and over $90,000) were also more likely to say they or a family member had researched prices online (19% and 17%) than adults with household incomes below $40,000 (11%). Democrats are somewhat more likely to say they researched prices for care online than Republicans (16% and 10%, respectively), though this could correlate with other factors beyond partisanship.",

            "People who did search for hospital prices were no more likely to be aware of the hospital price transparency requirements than those who did not search for prices. In fact, adults who did search for hospital prices were somewhat more likely to incorrectly say that there is no federal requirement (33%) than those who did not search for hospital prices (20%). Even if people search for prices on hospital websites, they may not find prices; ourearlier researchfound that many hospitals are not in compliance with the federal rules. Moreover, some hospitals havetaken measuresto make it harder for patients to search for prices.",
            "Price transparency requirements in health care generally havebipartisan support, with the latest rules on price disclosure promulgated by the Trump Administration. Addressing the cost of care continues to bea priorityfor Americans across both sides of the aisle. Price transparency may help some patients seek lower-priced care for non-emergency medical treatment and incur fewer costs, but the available pricing information has to be accessible and useful for that to happen, and patients would first need to be aware that they can find the price of care online. With only one in ten adults aware of the federal requirement for hospitals to publicly post prices for services, the potential for price transparency efforts to reduce costs remains a question.",

            "In December 2020, Congress passed the “No Surprises Act,” which prohibits most surprise out-of-network billing for plan years beginning in 2022.Surprise billsoccur when a patient receives care from an out-of-network provider or facility during an emergency visit or while receiving non-emergency care at an in-network hospital or facility. In these cases, patients may face balance billing from the out-of-network provider for the difference between the provider’s charged amount and the plan’s allowed amount for that service. Additionally, patients may have higher plan cost sharing for out-of-network services. We have previously found that among large group health plan enrollees,1 in 5emergency room visits and1 in 6in-network hospital admissions potentially led to a surprise medical bill.",
            "The No Surprises Act requires plans to apply in-network cost sharing and prohibits out-of-network providers from balance billing on surprise medical bills. Additional details on the No Surprises Act are availablehere. The law’s protections, however, do not apply to bills for ground ambulances, which Congress put off pending further study. The No Surprises Act requires the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Treasury to appoint an advisory committee that will review and recommend options to protect patients from ground ambulance surprise bills.",
            "This brief describes ambulance use, ownership type, the share of ground ambulance rides with a potential for surprise bills, and state or local policies aimed at reducing surprise bills for ground ambulances. Key findings include:",
            "Using data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we estimate that there were 29 million emergency room visits by privately insured patients in 2018. About 10% of these emergency room patients (3 million people) were brought to the emergency room by an ambulance.",
            "Many emergency medical transport services are operated by municipal and county governments, and therefore, may be subject to additional types of state and local regulation.Somemunicipal ground ambulance services may not contract with private insurance companies. Some publicly-operated ground ambulances may provide services as a public benefit and prohibit patient billing, as we discuss further below. State and local regulation and operation of ground ambulances wasreportedlyone reason that Congress did not include ground ambulances in the No Surprises Act.",
            "See more briefs and data.",
            "Using the National Emergency Medical Services Information System (NEMSIS) data, we find that 62% of emergency ground ambulance rides were provided by fire departments (37%) or other government (25%) organizations in 2020. Additionally, 30% of emergency ground ambulance rides were provided by private non-hospital ambulance companies and another 8% were provided by ambulances owned by hospitals.",
            "Using 2018 large employer claims data we find that 51% of emergency ground ambulance rides and 39% of non-emergency ground ambulance rides included an out-of-network charge for ambulance-related services, putting the patient at risk of a surprise medical bill.",
            "In seven states (Washington, California, Florida, Colorado, Texas, Illinois, and Wisconsin), more than two-thirds of emergency ground ambulance rides had an out-of-network charge for ambulance-related services. In Alabama, Kentucky, and Indiana, fewer than 25% of emergency ground ambulance rides included an out-of-network charge.",
            "In the absence of federal laws protecting patients from ground ambulance surprise bills, states and local governments play varying roles in regulating ground ambulance patient billing and insurer payments. There are two types of state laws that are important here: laws that regulate ambulance providers and laws that regulate how insurers treat claims from ambulance providers. While states cannot regulate the self-funded health plans that cover abouttwo-thirdsof workers in the U.S. (typically those employed at larger companies), state governments do regulate health insurers selling fully-insured coverage. Many states specifically protect patients from getting a ground ambulance surprise bill from providers. However, some of these state regulations only apply to a subset of ground ambulance agencies.",
            "State and local laws vary in whether ground ambulance service providers or health plans are regulated and types of ground ambulances that are prohibited from balance billing patients. For example,",
            "Protecting patients from surprise bills for ground ambulances requires additional considerations. The services that government-owned ground ambulances provide as a public benefit may be different than those that private ground ambulances provide. Billing practices may also differ for government-based or private ground ambulances.",
            "TheNo Surprises Actwill prohibit most surprise bills, reducing out-of-pocket costs for emergency services and non-emergency services where the patient unintentionally sees an out-of-network provider. Congress did not include ground ambulances in the No Surprises Actreportedlybecause so many emergency medical transport services are operated by municipal and county governments, and therefore, may be subject to additional types of state and local regulation. Congress expressed interest in revisiting surprise billing for ground ambulances once it gathers more information.",
            "One-in-ten emergency room visits for privately insured patients begin with an ambulance ride. Similar tootherstudies, we find that about half of emergency ground ambulance rides for large group enrollees include an out-of-network charge for ambulance-related services that may put people at risk of getting surprise bills.",
            "Taken together, as many as 1.5 million privately insured patients who are brought to an emergency room by an ambulance may be at risk of getting a surprise medical bill each year.",
            "Where there is state or local regulation of ground ambulance billing practices, those laws may protect only certain types of ground ambulance rides. State laws protecting patients from surprise out-of-network ground ambulance bills do not apply to self-insured health plans.",
            "The No Surprises Act requires the federal government to convene an advisory committee of federal and state officials, emergency medical services providers, and consumer representatives.",
            "The advisory committee will provide recommendations on ways to protect consumers from surprise bills for ground ambulances. The advisory committee will also review ground ambulance charges and fees to recommend health insurance payment practices to prevent ground ambulance balance billing. Further federal or state legislative action would most likely be needed to implement the advisory committee recommendations.",
            "The regulation and delivery of ground ambulance services could present complexities beyond those involved in preventing other surprise medical bills. Yet, from the perspective of patients, ambulance rides are exactly the kinds of situations where they feel powerless to avoid surprise bills.",
            "NHAMCS is a national probability survey of visits to hospital emergency departments. Using 2018 NHAMCS, we estimated the number of emergency department arrivals by ambulance for those younger than 65 with private insurance (‘paytyper’ variable equals “Private Insurance”). For more information on NHAMSC, seehere. One limitation is that a portion of these ambulance arrivals may include air ambulances, which are included in the surprise billing protections in the No Surprises Act. In addition, NHAMCS only includes ambulance rides which arrived at an emergency department.",
            "To assess ground ambulance ownership status, we evaluated the NEMSISdata. We included events with a ground ambulance, service in response to a 911 call, patient treated and transport by EMS, and a destination to a free-standing or hospital emergency room. Among these events, we calculated the share of ground ambulance rides by the organization ownership type.",
            "For the analysis of share of ground ambulance claims for large employer plans that included out-of-network charges for ambulance related-services, we analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2018 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65. This analysis used claims for 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age, state and whether the enrollee was a policy holder or dependent. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",
            "We identified days in which an enrollee had either an emergency or non-emergency ambulance ride with one of the following HCPCS codes:",
            "We excluded days that included an air ambulance charge. We then identified the share of ambulance rides with at least one out-of-network charge for ambulance-related services (which includes the following HCPCS codes: A0021, A0380, A0382, A0384, A0390, A0392, A0394, A0396, A0398, A0420, A0422, A0424, A0425, A0426, A0427, A0428, A0429, A0432, A0433, A0434, A0888, A0999). We did not include other out-of-network charges that may happen on the day (e.g., emergency department or in-patient hospital charges). The classification as an emergency or non-emergency ride depends on the HCPCS code and not whether the ride concluded at an emergency department. In our analysis, 70% of emergency and 19% of non-emergency ground ambulance rides had an emergency room visit on the same day.",

            "NOTE: This analysis was updated in April, 2021.",
            "Two major legislative efforts passed at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 – the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security(CARES) Act– required health coverage for COVID-19 testing – including the test itself, the related visit, and other services related to testing – with no cost-sharing for people covered by most private health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid. Federal laws also made resources available to finance free testing foruninsured individuals.",
            "Since enactment,questions have arisenabout the scope of protections and when they apply. For example, some plans denied COVID-19 testing claims or applied cost sharing for COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic individuals unless they had known or suspected exposed to COVID-19 and had a referral for testing from their provider. Some denied COVID-19 testing claims unless directly ordered by a physician.",
            "Federalguidancereleased in early 2021 under the Biden Administration clarified that insurers must cover testing without cost sharing for asymptomatic individuals and without requiring medical screenings. However, insurers are not required to cover COVID-19 testing without cost-sharing if it is conducted as part of employee return-to-work programs or public health surveillance purposes. Such limits mean some patients with health coverage may nonetheless receive bills for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and related services, and those bills often can be widely different from patient to patient.",
            "Outside of the Medicare program, there is no federal regulation of thepriceof COVID-19 diagnostic tests or other related tests and visits. Much like for other health services, hospitals and laboratories can set their own rates for privately insured and uninsured individuals. Private health insurers negotiate allowed charges with hospitals and providers participating in their network. In the absence of a negotiated rate for out-of-network providers, insurers must pay the provider’s cash price – sometimes called the list price – for COVID-19 testing and related services. The CARES Actrequires providersto post the cash price on their public website for insurer use. These CARES Act coverage and payment requirements apply during the duration of the public health emergency.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health Spending",
            "Negotiated rates (between payers and theirin-networkproviders for COVID-19 testing) are not always publicly available. However, the CARES Act price transparency rule provides a unique opportunity to examine what insurers pay forout-of-networkcare that is required to be covered. In this brief, we present the findings from our search for COVID-19 test prices, which we conducted from April 20 through April 27, 2021. For each state, we searched for COVID-19 test prices posted on public websites of the two largest hospitals. We were able to find COVID-19 diagnostic test prices for 93 out of 102 hospitals, ranging from $20 – $1,419 per single test, not including the price of a provider visit, facility fee, or specimen collection. These services are required to be covered by insurance; nonetheless patients may experience problems with billing or claims denials. Some patients may be billed for testing-related care from the hospital, a provider, or the insurer. We examine federal requirements and guidance on who can be charged for COVID-19 testing and related services. We then end with a broad discussion on how the uncertainty around what patients will be charged for health care services interacts with federal attempts at price transparency.",
            "Medicare covers testing without cost-sharing for patients, and reimburses providers between $36 to $143 per diagnostic test, depending on the type of test and how quickly the test is processed. However, since there are no regulations on pricing in the private market, the price insurers must pay in-network hospitals and providers under current law is their established and negotiated rate for the service. The CARES Act requires insurers to reimburse out-of-network providers the cash price of COVID-19 tests posted on the provider’s website, though they may choose to bargain that price down on a claim-by-claim basis.",
            "We searched the websites of the two largest hospitals in each state and the District of Columbia to see whether the cash price for COVID-19 diagnostic tests were available, and how much those prices varied (see Methods). We found price information for COVID-19 diagnostic tests online for 93 out of the 102 hospital websites we examined. Prices for COVID-19 tests presented in this analysis do not include the price of related services, such as COVID-19 screenings conducted in-office or through telemedicine, or for specimen collection; however, some hospitals also post pricing information for these. Some COVID diagnostic tests may be billed as a panel and include detection for other viruses as well, such as influenza. COVID diagnostic tests that include testing for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are included in this analysis.",
            "We observed a broad range of COVID-19 testing prices, even within the same hospital system. A given hospital may choose to post different prices for a test for a number of reasons, including the type of test, where it was conducted, and which laboratory analyzes the medical sample.",
            "Confirmation of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19) is done viateststhat use molecular “PCR” amplification and antigen-based lab technology. Data from 93 hospitals with listed prices yielded 203 distinct prices for diagnostic tests. The prices ranged between $20 – $1,419 per diagnostic test, with a median of $148. Nearly half of test charges (47%) were priced between $100 – $199, and one in five (20%) were priced above $300.",
            "The price of diagnostic tests can vary based on the type of test performed, where it is processed, the manufacturer, and CDC affiliation. We found hospital prices for laboratory tests developed by the CDC were generally lower than for other non-CDC tests, and tests utilizing high throughput technology – allowing for faster analysis of samples – were priced higher. Since we conducted this analysis in 2020, there has been an increase in the number of different COVID diagnostic tests, particularly respiratory panels that test for COVID as well as other viruses. For example, respiratory panels that include detection for  SARS-CoV-2 and the flu tend to be priced more highly than those that just test for the coronavirus.",
            "Self-pay rates.While there are federal and state resources that cover the cost of COVID testing for many uninsured patients, they may still face costs or be billed for care in certain circumstances. Thirty-nine hospitals listed the exact discounted rate or price of COVID-19 diagnostic tests for self-pay individuals, which ranged between $32 to $478 per test. A number of additional hospitals indicated on their websites that uninsured or self-pay individuals who didn’t qualify for governmental programs such as Medicaid could receive free or discounted care through hospital financial assistance programs. Patients receiving discounts would be charged for a portion of the listed price (e.g. 75% or 50% of the list price), though finding the exact amount of the discount can be challenging and often entails contacting the hospital to apply for discounted care.",
            "Related costs.Aside from the cost of a diagnostic test itself, hospitals also bill for specimen collection and the visit itself, whether in-person or through telemedicine. In most cases, the total cost of care for a test and its related services was not easily distinguishable on hospital websites. However, 30 hospitals clearly posted the list price for specimen collection, which ranged from $18- $240. One hospital listed three different charges based on where the specimen was collected – in a skilled nursing facility, at home, or an outpatient setting.",
            "For self-pay individuals, the cost of screening as well as testing may add up. In our review in 2020, one hospital’s price estimator tool demonstrated that the price of COVID-19 screening would be $77 before discounts, and $31 after applying a 60% discount for qualifying self-pay individuals. Such charges in addition to the cost of a diagnostic test and specimen collection can be financially burdensome or prohibitive for uninsured or self-pay patients, especially given the current labor market and high rates of unemployment.",
            "With the FFCRA and the CARES Act, Congress signaled that it wants to eliminate cost barriers for COVID-19 testing for patients, whether they are insured or not. While the Biden Administration has clarified that all testing conducted for diagnostic purposes must be covered – including testing for asymptomatic people and without requiring medical screenings – there are still cases in which patients may be billed for tests; for example, if they are billed directly from an out-of-network provider. Some patients still face out-of-pocket costs related to COVID-19 testing, which our analysis shows can be high and unpredictable.",
            "Patients who seek a test, but don’t receive one, may still be billed for COVID-19 test-related services.Federal law requires health plans to cover visits (and other related services) that result in the administration of COVID-19 testing with no cost sharing. News reports have described insured patients who faced medical bills after they sought COVID-19 testing but were not given a test.For example, one patient experiencing symptoms sought emergency care but was not tested because the facility did not have COVID-19 test kits available. Her health plan applied the deductible to the emergency visit, leaving the patient to pay more than $1,800.",
            "For out-of-network COVID-19 tests, private plans are required to pay the full price that is posted online.However, federal law is silent with respect to the amount a health plan must pay for out-of-network testing and related services if the provider has not posted a cash price online and if the health plan and the provider cannot agree on a negotiated rate. Guidance issued by the federal government notes only that the out-of-network provider who fails to post prices online may be liable for a civil money penalty of up to $300 per day. Onenews storydescribed an insured patient who faced high out-of-pocket costs after she received COVID-19 testing from an out-of-networkfree-standing emergency roomthat does not appear to have posted prices for COVID-19 testing services online.",
            "Federal law does not require out-of-network providers to bill insurance directly for COVID-19 tests.Typically, providers that participate in a patient’s health plan network are contracted to bill that patient’s insurance directly and collect no more than in-network cost sharing directly from the patient. While the law requires coverage of out-of-network testing without cost sharing, patients who seek COVID-19 testing out-of-network may berequired to pay up frontfor services, then submit claims to their health plan for reimbursement. Patients who don’t know how to manually submit out-of-network claims or who are too sick to do so may not succeed.",
            "Federal coverage requirements apply only to individualized diagnostic testing, but not when conducted as part of employee “return to work” programs.Guidanceissued by federal agencies states that health plans “are not required to provide coverage of testing such as for public health surveillance or employment purposes. But there is also no prohibition or limitation on plans and issuers providing coverage for such tests.” To the extent employers may expect or require their workers to be tested periodically for COVID-19, private health plans would not be required to cover such testing costs. However, employers that do require periodic testing for workers could choose to cover the cost of testing for their employees.",
            "Federal requirements to cover COVID-19 tests do not apply to certain private plans.The FFCRA and CARES Act coverage requirements do not apply to non-ACA compliant plans, such as short-term health insurance policies. Somehealth insurersandshort-term policy issuershave said they will voluntarily waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 tests under all of their policies.",
            "While the FFCRA and the CARES Act attempted to reduce COVID-19 testing costs for consumers, the cost and growing volume of testing could affect the cost of insurance overall. The list prices posted by 93 hospitals for COVID-19 tests vary widely and, in most cases, are significantly higher than the amount Medicare allows.  Some patients might not be fully protected from receiving bills for COVID-19 testing or testing-related services. Patients in some circumstances may incur charges for related services, including the visit (in-person or telehealth) during which the patient is evaluated, the collection of test specimen, and other diagnostic tests or procedures ordered to confirm COVID-19 or rule out other possible conditions. These prices can also be high and unpredictable. Further complicating any effort to identify or categorize prices, the charges for COVID-19 testing and related services may be in a bundle, or the patient may receive separate bills from the hospital or testing facility, the attending health professional, the laboratory, and other providers involved in care. Unexpected bills for some or all of the charges can place significant financial strain on individuals and their families, and force patients to makedifficult decisionsabout whether to pay for care or other household expenses.",
            "These issues with health care costs are not new. The prices of medical care have been notoriously opaque in the U.S. Both insured and uninsured patients often only find out the full cost after they’ve received bills for their care. Hospitals and insurers have historically kept their negotiated rates secret, allowing the same provider to charge different rates for the same service. In an attempt to make the cost of care more transparent for patients and increase competition among providers and insurers, CMS released a final rule in November 2019 requiring hospitals to make public their standard charges, discounted charges, and insurer-negotiated rates for common services, effective January 2021. Whileprice transparencyin healthcare is not a panacea to high costs,implementationare also preventing patients and others from accessing full information on hospital prices.",
            "We searched the websites of 102 different non-governmental adult hospitals for 50 states plus Washington D.C. to collect prices for COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody tests. The top two largest hospitals were defined as those with the most number of hospital beds, using data from the 2018 American Healthcare Association Annual Survey of Hospitals. These 102 hospitals represent 12.5% of total non-governmental hospitals beds in the U.S. In some states, these hospitals comprise a much greater share of total hospitals beds in that state. Some hospitals in the sample belong to larger health systems. In the five states where the top two largest hospitals were owned by the same health system, the hospitals had the same price for COVID-19 tests. In these states, we examined the prices of the third largest hospital in the state.",
            "To find list prices, we systematically examined hospital websites between April 20 – 27, 2021 for this update. In 2020, prices for COVID tests were collected between  June 15 – June 22, 2020.",
            "We searched their billing and financials pages for sub-pages on price transparency or standard hospital charges. Many hospital websites had pages on price transparency in accordance with CMS rules on price transparency. When available, chargemasters or documents containing list prices of COVID-19 and/or other medical services were downloaded and then searched for COVID-19 tests. The chargemasters were searched using the terms “covid”, “sars”, “cov” and “coronavirus”. Some websites had price estimator tools, and those tools were also utilized to attempt to find COVID-19 test prices, but these often did not yield results. For these tools, we used the search terms “covid”, “sars”, “cov”, “coronavirus” along with the CPT codes “87635”, “87636”, “86318”, “86769”, and HCPCS codes “u0002’, “u0003”, “u0004”, “u00002”, and “u00003” when applicable.",
            "For websites that didn’t have downloadable chargemasters, or for websites in which downloadable chargemasters did not contain price information for COVID-19 tests, we examined the remainder of the billing and financial information webpages, COVID-19 information webpages, and other related pages in “patients and visitors” sections of the hospital website. Finally, we searched the hospital website for price information using the terms including “price transparency”, “COVID test”, “COVID test cost”, “COVID test price”, “chargemaster” and “standard charges”. If this exhaustive search did not yield results, the hospital was coded as not having COVID-19 price information. While some hospitals indicated that price information could be requested through phone, email, or request forms, we did not contact hospitals for this information since the CARES Act required public posting of this information.",
            "COVID-19 tests were identified by name or by code. Costs for specimen collection were only included if they were easily identifiable or grouped with COVID-19 test prices. When hospitals indicated discount rates or different prices for self-pay individuals, the separate price was included in our sample. When hospitals clearly listed discounts for self-pay as related to COVID-19 testing, those prices were calculated accordingly and collected.",
            "The descriptions for the tests were often written in a medical billing shorthand and not standardized across all hospitals. We included COVID test prices for  CPT codes 87635, 87636, 87637, 87811, 87426, and HCPCS U0001, U0002, U0003, U0004, but did not include CPT 0202u.",

            "As of January 1, under federal rules issued by the Trump Administration, hospitals are required to publish the price of health services by payer. The federal rule aims to improve price competition by requiring hospitals to publicly list the hospital gross charge, discounted rate, and payer-specific negotiated rates for all available health services and items.",
            "These prices must be made publicly available in a “machine-readable file” on the hospital’s website to support third-party collection and use of price data to inform research, purchasing tools, and policymaking. The rule also aims to help patients shop for lower-priced care, and to that end requires hospitals to provide a consumer-friendly online tool with prices for 300 common services. (To help patients estimate out-of-pocket costs, a separate rule requires health plans to provide enrollees with online tools that would allow patients to compare prices with out-of-pocket cost information for covered services; this rule will be implemented 2022-2024).",
            "In this brief, we focus on the recently effective hospital price transparency rule to assess hospital compliance and examine how payer-negotiated rates vary. First, we describe the requirements in the rule. Then, we show how prices can vary for the same service (an MRI of the lower spine) across select hospitals that provide payer-specific negotiated rates. Finally, we describe the major challenges with the implementation of the price transparency rule. These challenges have been identified through our analysis of the websites of two of the largest hospitals in each state and the District of Columbia.",
            "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires hospitals to publish and update a list of “standard charges” for services and items available at the hospital with an established charge. The recent hospital price transparency ruledefinesstandard charge as “the regular rate established by the hospital for an item or service provided to a specific group of paying patients” and includes the following: 1) gross charge; 2) payer-specific negotiated charge; 3) de-identified minimum negotiated charge 4) de-identified maximum negotiated charge; and 5) discounted cash price. Under the rule, hospitals must publicly post these five charges for at least 300 common services and items on their website, accessible through a consumer-friendly tool. The information must include descriptions of the health service or item, along with a common billing code. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has specified 70 shoppable services that must be made available across all hospitals, and hospitals can choose the remainder. The rule specifies that the information must be displayed prominently and be accessible without requiring patients to submit personally identifiable information. Price information must be searchable by service description, common billing code, and payer. The tool must specify the location at which the shoppable service is provided, and whether the rates apply to an inpatient setting, outpatient setting, or both.",
            "The rule also requires that such price information be published in a “machine-readable file” for all services and items provided by the hospital. Like the consumer tool, the machine-readable file must be displayed prominently and accessible online without barriers, including without cost or requirement to provide personally identifying information. Such files theoretically could be aggregated into a database of prices for services to facilitate comparisons across hospitals, payers, and location.  This information is intended to be most directly useful for employers, providers, and developers for consumer-friendly price transparency tools or for shared decision-making during the point of care, according to aCMS release.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Health Spending",
            "Because the same payer (insurer) may negotiate different prices under different specific plans, the rule requires that each of those rates is clearly presented with the name of the third-party payer and plan with which it is associated. For example, an insurer offering a private plan, Medicare Advantage plan, and Medicaid managed care plan must separately list the negotiated for those distinct plans. Prices must be made available for all services and items, including drugs administered in the hospital, though the prices do not reflect discounts or rebates.",
            "Hospitals that do not comply with the transparency rules will be required to submit a corrective action plan to CMS and correct failures within the designated timeline in the plan. If hospitals do not comply with the requirements of the corrective action plan, they may be fined up to a modest $300 per day per hospital until they comply. CMS has the authority to monitor hospital compliance by auditing hospitals’ websites and evaluating and reviewing complaints of noncompliance made by individuals or entities.",
            "Many studies show that prices for health services in the U.S. vary significantlynationally, across private and public insurancemarkets, and even withincities. The newly available price data published by hospitals also illustrate how much prices for the same service varywithina hospital. The chart below shows the range of payer-specific negotiated rates for an MRI of the lower spinal canal at ten selected hospitals that provided this data, downloaded from those websites between January and March of 2021. (These hospitals are some of the few we identified that provided multiple payer-negotiated rates for a lower spinal MRI.) For context, our analysis ofclaims datafinds that the price of an MRI of the lower spine paid by large employer health plans averages $861 nationally in 2018, with average prices ranging from $400 to $1,100 across major metropolitan areas.",
            "Within a few hospital in our sample, prices vary by the specific payer and its market segment, with Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans generally paying lower rates than commercial plans (though the data provided by most hospitals does not clearly indicate in which market a payer is operating). For instance, at University of New Mexico Hospitals, for an MRI of the lower spine, the range of negotiated rates varied between $486 – $1821 in the private insurance market; from $221 – $331 for Medicare Advantage plans; and from $350 – $485 for Medicaid managed care plans.",
            "In this analysis, we examined the websites of the two largest hospitals in each state to find the share of hospitals that provided gross charges, payer-specific negotiated rates, and discounted self-pay rates on both a consumer-friendly tool and a machine-readable file (see Methods).",
            "The gross charge refers to the undiscounted charge a hospital applies to a given health service or item. Payer-specific negotiated rates are the prices that hospitals and payers have negotiated for a given service; these prices may vary across a payer’s different plan types. The discounted rate is the price a hospital sets for uninsured or self-pay patients.",
            "While most of the hospitals we searched provided some price information (such as the gross charge), many hospitals did not provide the public with payer-specific negotiated rates for their services. Only three of the hospitals in our sample provided payer-specific negotiated rates on their consumer tools without requiring a patient to provide personally identifying information (including their insurance membership details). Meanwhile, while 35 of the hospitals we examined provided payer-negotiated rates on a machine-readable file, it is unclear whether all participating insurers were included in these files. Also, in some machine-readable files, hospitals provided payer names but did not include actual negotiated rates from those payers. In some cases, payer names were provided, but the associated plan name or market was not listed.",
            "About 3 out of 4 hospitals in our analysis provided gross charges for services to the public. While most people do not pay the gross charge, these rates can serve as a baseline for negotiating rates with payers. They also can be a reference point for the cost of care for individuals without insurance. For example, a hospital may provide a flat 30% discount off the gross charge for an uninsured individual and bill accordingly. Fifty-six percent of hospitals provided a rate for discounted care on their consumer tools, and only 42% did so on their machine-readable files.",
            "An important goal of price transparency in health care is to reduce the cost of care by increasing price competition. The rule aims to improve competition in two ways: one, by giving patients the option of shopping for lower-priced care, and two, by revealing to health plans and hospitals the rates their competitors have set for the same services.",
            "The data provided by hospitals, where they comply with the rule, may allow for comparisons of priceswithina given hospital. For example, using this data, health plans can identify the prices paid by other payers and potentially use that information to negotiate lower rates. However, among the few hospitals in this analysis that do provide payer-negotiated rates, the markets in which the payer operates is not always clear. And, due to a lack of standardization, comparing pricesacrosshospitals is problematic. For reasons outlined below, consumers, payers, employers, researchers, and others attempting to compare prices for services across hospitals should use caution.",
            "Price estimates do not always allow for an apples-to-apples comparison.We found that the price of a service from one provider might not be comparable to the price of the same service from another provider, even when presented by billing code.",
            "Price estimates are different between the consumer tool and the machine-readable file.Price estimates for the same service, as identified by unique billing code and service descriptions, often differed between a hospital’s tool and their machine-readable file.  This discrepancy was noted in several hospitals, pointing to inconsistencies in hospital pricing policies.",
            "Price estimates may change over a short period of time.Patients attempting to shop for health services may find that the prices change over a short period of time, and as a result, could face unexpectedly high bills. During the month we collected price estimates, we sometimes found that the estimate for a service on the consumer tool changed over a short period of time. Many hospitals provided a disclaimer stating that the price was subject to change and was simply an “estimate” of the total cost.",
            "The price information provided in machine-readable files was not complete.Hospitals are required to post gross charges, discounted rates, and payer-negotiated rates for all the services and items they provide, but finding comprehensive files includingallservices acrossallpayers and rates was uncommon. For instance, one hospital that had a large and seemingly comprehensive file of prices for services by payer did not have prices for the three common “shoppable” services we examined. Another hospital only provided payer-negotiated rates for Medicare Advantage plans. Other files did not identify services by common billing codes or commonly used descriptions, which made finding a service and its price difficult.",
            "Price information can be hard to access or comprehend.While many hospital websites contained pages with information explaining the cost of care and price transparency initiatives,accessingthe customer-friendly tools and machine-readable files was not always straightforward or easy. A recent Wall Street Journalinvestigationfound that some hospitals have added code that prevents the machine-readable files from appearing in online searches. While many machine-readable files can still be accessed directly through hospital websites, they could be hard to locate on those websites, or require multiple clicks and scrolling through pages. For instance, in this analysis we found that while some hospital websites had specific “price transparency” pages with downloadable files, others required consumers to search through “billing and insurance” pages and sub-pages to find the files.",
            "Most hospital website’s consumer tools that we examined generally required patients to input personally-identifying information. (The majority of the hospitals in our analysis used the tool called MyChart, powered by Epic Systems Corporation.) Such tools required patients to know complex medical terminology or billing codes to search for prices. It is unlikely that most patients would use these tools as they exist.",
            "Unlike most industries, the prices for services in health care are notoriously hard to pinpoint and vary drastically given a variety of factors. The new price transparency rule is intended to help lift the veil on the full range of those prices for consumers, insurers, employers, and researchers. As intended by the rule, payer-specific negotiated rates in the machine-readable files could help insurers, employers, providers, tool developers, and other third-party actors to identify lower-priced providers and inform plan network decisions.",
            "However, in practice, price transparency data is neither consistently available nor reliable. Most hospitals do not fully comply with the rule. Those that do comply and provide payer-specific negotiated rates vary in what prices they show, how they define price (e.g. does it include both facility and professional fees?), and whether they provide payer-specific negotiated rates for all their participating payers. For example, it is not always clear in which market an insurer operates, and this can drastically affect the price of a given service. The lack of standardization in both the definition of “price” as well as the format of machine-readable files across hospitals makes it impossible to reliably compare prices across hospitals. We found significant inconsistencies in how the files are formatted, the level of detail in payer names and markets, which billing codes are used, and what the measurement of price is. Anyone attempting to make comparisons across hospitals using these data should therefore exercise caution.",
            "For price transparency data to be useful in making comparisons across hospitals, data in the files would need to follow a set template, such that all hospitals use consistent file formats, billing codes, service descriptions, and insurer and market naming formats. The results from implementation thus far demonstrate a wide range in interpretation and compliance with the hospital rule and may suggest similar challenges with implementation of the insurer-focused rule in 2022 if standardization is not enforced.",
            "We searched the websites of 102 different non-governmental adult hospitals for 50 states plus the District of Columbia to collect the machine-readable file and the consumer-friendly tool data cited in this brief. The top two largest hospitals were defined as those with the greatest number of hospital beds, using data from the 2018 American Healthcare Association Annual Survey of Hospitals. These 102 hospitals represent 12.5% of total non-governmental hospitals beds in the U.S. In some states, these hospitals comprise a much greater share of total hospitals beds in that state. Some hospitals in the sample belong to larger health systems.",
            "We systematically examined hospital websites between January and March, 2021. In each hospital website, we searched through their billing and financial pages for sub-pages on price transparency or standard hospital charges. Many hospital websites had pages on price transparency in accordance with CMS rules on price transparency. Then, when available, the machine-readable files (generally in comma separated value or XLS formats) were downloaded. Similarly, for websites that had price estimator tools we collected the available gross charges, discounted rates, and negotiated rates data as available.",
            "For websites that did not have downloadable files, or for websites in which downloadable files did not contain any price information, we examined the remainder of the billing and financial information webpages and other related pages to identify price information, though this rarely resulted in additional data. When this did not yield results, the hospital was coded as not having the given price information. While some hospitals indicated that price information could be requested through phone, email, or request forms, we did not contact hospitals for this information because the rule requires public posting of this information. The same procedure was followed for price information derived from the consumer-friendly tool.",
            "In the files and the consumer-friendly tool, we identified the services primarily by standard code, though occasionally descriptive information was used. We used CPT 72148 to capture “MRI scan of lower spinal canal (w/out contrast)”, and collected the associated gross charge, discounted rate, and negotiated rate, as available. When different rates were available in inpatient and outpatient settings, both were catalogued.",

            "Researchers have used a variety of measures to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including deaths directlyattributedto COVID-19 infection and deaths inexcessof prior years’ death rates. However, these measures do not incorporate the prematurity of deaths or differences in age at death between countries. While the elderly have been at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill due to COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 also affected mortality rates among younger individuals.",
            "In this brief, we review excess death rates in the U.S. and peer countries by age groups to examine how the pandemic has affected excess mortality rate among younger people. We look specifically at the excess deaths that arose in 2020 to examine how the age at death during the pandemic has differed between the U.S. and peer nations. We also estimate the excess potential years of life lost (a measure of “premature excess death”) during the pandemic, and explore racial disparities in the age of death in the U.S.",
            "We find that, among similarly large and wealthy countries, the U.S. had among the highest excess mortality rates in 2020, and younger people were more likely to have died due to the pandemic in the U.S. than younger people in other countries. With a much higher rate of death among people under age 75, the U.S. had the highest increase in premature deaths due the pandemic in 2020. Before the pandemic, the U.S. already had thehighestpremature death rate of peer nations, by far. We find that per capita premature excess death rate in the U.S. was over twice as high as the next closest peer country, the U.K. The higher rate of new premature deaths in the U.S. compared to peer countries was driven in part by racial disparities within the U.S. Looking at age differences in excess mortality by race, we find that American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), Hispanic, Black, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) people in the U.S. were more likely to have died at younger ages during the pandemic in 2020 than non-elderly White or Asian adults in the U.S.",
            "During the pandemic, the U.S. lost an additional 3.6 million potential years of life in 2020. Among excess deaths in 2020, the average person lost 14 years in the U.S. compared to an average of 8 years in peer countries before the age of 75. Excess mortality rates were higher among younger people of color, in part, leading to higher premature excess deaths among people of color in the U.S. Of the potential years of life lost in the U.S., 30% were among Black people and another 31% were among Hispanic people, compared to their share of the U.S. population at 12.2% and 18.5%, respectively. Although discussions in the U.S. of how to mitigate the continued impact of COVID-19 have often pegged the economy against deaths among the elderly, the pandemic has also led to high excess mortality rates among younger people, including working age adults.",
            "People over the age of 65 are at particularly high risk of serious complications and death arising from COVID-19 infection, but COVID-19 was also a leading cause of death among younger people in the U.S. During the pandemic, we find that the U.S. saw the largest per capita increase in deaths among younger (non-elderly) people, among similarly large and wealthy nations in 2020.",

            "“Excess deaths” represent the number of deaths beyond what is expected in a typical year. This measure illustrates the mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "To compare excess deaths between the U.S. and peer countries, we analyzed the Human Mortality Data for deaths in 2020 over the average deaths in a typical year. Among peer countries, the U.S. had the highest overall excess mortality rate in 2020 with 160 excess deaths per 100,000 people across all ages. Belgium was only slightly behind with 155 excess deaths per 100,000 people across all ages. The U.K. had the third highest excess mortality rate in 2020 with 122 excess deaths per 100,000 people in 2020 across all ages. In one peer country (Australia) that had a low incidence of COVID-19 deaths, the excess mortality rate in 2020 even fell across all ages. The Human Mortality Database did not include data on Japan, but according to other analyses, excess mortality rate also fell inJapanin 2020.",
            "The U.S. had by far the highest excess mortality rate among younger people under age 75 in 2020. Although Belgium was only slightly behind the U.S. in overall excess mortality, most of the excess deaths in Belgium were among the elderly, particularly ages 75 and older. Almost half (48%) of excess deaths in the U.S. were among people younger than 75 years, whereas only 18% of excess deaths in Belgium were among people younger than 75. The excess mortality rate per 100,000 people in the age group was almost 10 times higher among people ages 15-64 in the U.S. than in Belgium and 68% higher among people ages 65-74 in the U.S. than in Belgium.",
            "We evaluated racial disparities in excess mortality by age groups using CDC excess death data comparing deaths in 2020 over average deaths in 2015-2019. Excess mortality rates among younger people were higher for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), Black, and Hispanic people than for other groups. Among AIAN people ages 15-64, excess deaths were 195 per capita in 2020, which is 44% higher than the excess mortality rate in the next closest group, NHOPI people ages 15-64, with 136 excess deaths per 100,000 people. Excess mortality rate in the 65-74 age group was the highest for Black people (976 excess deaths per capita), followed by Hispanic people (835 excess deaths per capita). Mortality rates among the elderly ages over 75 were higher among Hispanic, Black, AIAN, Asian, and NHOPI people compared to White people in the U.S.",
            "The high excess death rate among non-elderly people in the U.S. is likely due to direct and indirect deaths caused by COVID-19. We compared CDC reported COVID-19 deaths to the total excess deaths based on the Human Mortality Database by age groups in the U.S. in 2020.",
            "Deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 accounted for two thirds of excess deaths in the U.S. in 2020. COVID-19 deaths as a share of excess deaths are lower among younger age groups. Nonetheless, COVID-19 is attributed for a majority of excess deaths among ages 15-64 (56%) and ages 65-74 (59%). There is reason to suspect that many of the excess deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19 could still have been caused by COVID-19 infection (due to inadequate testing, particularly early in the pandemic). This suggests the true toll of the pandemic might be undercounted in the COVID-19 mortality rates by a large margin. CDC hasstatedthat the death count from causes that could be related to COVID-19 infections have also increased in 2020 (such as heart diseases, strokes, and Alzheimer’s disease and dementia). Additionally, CDCdatashows deaths due to other causes also increased in 2020, including due to increasedoverdosefatalities. So, the difference between the excess deaths and the deaths attributed to COVID-19 might be because of an undercount of COVID-19 deaths, and the indirect impact of the pandemic leading to additional fatalities, including due to delayed or foregone care.",
            "“Potential years of life lost” measures premature deaths and is used to compare differences in disease burden and longevity across countries. This measure is calculated by summing the years of life up to a limit of life expectancy from the age at death. To compare the extent of premature deaths in the U.S. and peer nations, we calculated the potential years of life lost up to age 75 using excess deaths during 2020 (the deaths beyond those expected in a normal year). In this analysis we follow the methods of the OECD, which recently began using75years as the age limit in calculation of potential years of life lost. Although excess deaths over age of 75 in 2020 were also premature compared to a typical year, they are not included in the potential years of life lost calculation as defined by the OECD.",
            "The U.S. already had the highestprematuredeath rate before the pandemic. Here, we look at premature deaths in excess of those in a typical year, which we refer to as premature “excess” deaths, or “excess” potential years of life lost. The premature excess death rate shows the number of excess potential life years per capita that may be lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic over a typical year and indicates a rise in premature death in 2020. The number of excess potential years of life lost increased in the U.S. more than in other countries in 2020, which means the COVID-19 pandemic has widened the gap between the U.S. and peer countries in premature deaths.",
            "We calculate excess potential years of life lost using the number ofexcess deathsfrom theHuman Mortality Databaseup to the age limit of 75. As an illustration, each excess death in the 65-74 age group is counted as losing 5.5 potential years of life (75 age limit minus 69.5 equals 5.5 years). U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)datashow that weighted average excess death age in the 15-64 age group is 50 years. Because more granular age at death data were not available in all countries, we used an age of 50 (based on data in the U.S.) to calculate excess potential years of life lost to the age limit of 75 for the 15-64 age group for all countries. This decision is conservative and might make the gap between the U.S. and other countries appear smaller than it is, because 50 years of age is likely lower than the average age at death in the 15-64 age group in comparison countries. As a final step, we summed excess potential years of life lost across ages 0-74 for excess potential years of life lost in each nation. For comparison across countries, the premature excess death rates were calculated per 100,000 people within each age group in each country.",
            "The U.S. had the highest premature excess death rate per capita among peer countries in 2020 across all ages. We find that more young (non-elderly) people died in the U.S. than in a typical year and at a higher per capita rate than in peer countries. Based on the Human Mortality Database, the U.S. had 1,171 excess potential years of life lost up to age 75 per 100,000 people among ages 0-74. Relative to a typical year, the U.S. lost an additional 3.6 million potential years of life in total in 2020.",
            "The U.K. had the next closest premature excess death rate in 2020 with 488 excess potential years of life lost per 100,000 people, which is less than half the U.S. rate. Canada had the third highest premature excess death rate with 384 excess potential years of life lost per 100,000 people ages 0-74 in 2020, which is about one third of the U.S. rate.",
            "The United States’ significantly higher excess death rate among younger age groups in 2020 causes it to have the highest premature excess death rate among peer nations. These premature excess deaths are in addition to the alreadyhigh rateof potential years of life lost in the U.S. compared to peer nations in a typical year. The U.S. was among 5 peer countries (U.S., U.K., Canada, Austria, Belgium) with increased potential life years lost in the 15-64 age group in 2020, whereas the remaining peer countries actually saved life years in this age group in 2020 over a typical year. The COVID-19 pandemic led to higher excess death rate among people ages 15-74 in the U.S. than in peer countries. As noted above, while Belgium had the highest overall COVID-19 death rate and the second highest excess death rate among peer countries in 2020, the increased mortality rate in Belgium was largely due to a higher death rate among the elderly. Belgium ranked #5 among peer countries in premature excess death rate up to age 75, despite having the second-highest overall rate of excess mortality among peer countries because deaths in Belgium were more concentrated among older people.",
            "Using theCDCdata on excess deaths by race and ethnicity and age groups, we find that American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), Black, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI), and Hispanic people had over 3 times premature excess deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S. in 2020 than the rate among White or Asian people. AIAN people ages 15-64 had the highest premature excess death rate (3,843), driving the 40% higher premature excess death rate among AIAN people ages 0-74 than the next highest group. The premature excess death rate was 2,737 among Black people ages 0-74, 2,737 among NHOPI people, and 2,476 among Hispanic people. Premature excess death rates among White and Asian people were lower than the overall rate, with 632 and 591 excess potential years lost per 100,000 people ages 0-74 in each group, respectively. Life expectancy already varied by race and ethnicity prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.Life expectancyat birth in 2017 was 74.9 years, 78.5 years, and 81.8 years for Black, White, and Hispanic people, respectively. Of the 3.6 million excess potential years of life lost in the U.S. in 2020, 1.1 million excess life years were lost among Black people, another 1.1 million excess life years were lost among Hispanic people, and 1.1 million excess life years were lost among White people. As a share of the U.S. population, Black people represent 13%, Hispanic people represent 18%, and White people represent 60%.",
            "The pandemic appears to have significantly widened the gap in premature deaths in the U.S. and peer countries.Premature deathrates in the U.S. were already higher than in peer countries prior to the pandemic. Our analysis of premature excess deaths indicates the gap in premature deaths between the U.S. and peer countries has increased due to the pandemic.",
            "The higher excess mortality rate among younger people in the U.S. is likely due in part to higher COVID-19risk factorrates among younger people in the U.S., and may also reflect differences in public health responses across countries. Overhalfof people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the U.S. had obesity, and the U.S. has by far thehighestrate of obesity among peer countries. The majority ofexcess deathsin 2020 are directly attributable to COVID-19 and many of those excess deaths that are not attributed to COVID-19 may be undiagnosed COVID-19 deaths, particularly early in the pandemic when widespread testing was not available. However, higher rates of death fromoverdosesmay also be a contributing factor to the United States’ high premature excess death rate in 2020, particularly among younger people.",
            "The higher premature excess death rate in the U.S. compared to peer nations was driven in part due to racial disparities. Younger people of color were more likely to have died in the U.S. during the pandemic in 2020 than white non-elderly individuals. American Indian and Alaska Native, Black, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, and Hispanic people had over 3 times the premature excess death rate in the U.S. in 2020 than the rate among other groups. American Indian and Alaska Native people had a 40% higher premature excess death rate over the next highest group.",
            "Additional analysis of CDCdatashows that COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death among people ages 65 and over, and the fourth leading cause among people younger than 65 years in 2020. During the winter surge, in December 2020 and January 2021, COVID-19 was the leading cause of death both among people younger than 65 and those ages 65 and over in the U.S.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health of populations and economies in the U.S. and elsewhere. To be sure, the elderly are at the highest risk of death from COVID-19 infection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has not left younger people unharmed. Among peer nations, the U.S. had the highest excess mortality rate of non-elderly adults in 2020, and therefore, had the highest increase in premature death rate among peer countries in 2020. Although prevention measures have been weighed against the impact on the economy, loss of non-elderly adults may also have an impact on long-term economic productivity. Even after many of the elderly at the highest risk of serious illness from COVID-19 infection are vaccinated, social distancing measures will continue to be important to prevent infection, serious illness, hospitalizations, and deaths among unvaccinated younger people, as well as to mitigate long-term economic impacts for non-elderly adults.",
            "The Human Mortality Database Short-term Mortality Fluctuations (STMF)datawere used to calculate the excess deaths through the 2020 MMWR week 52 in peer countries by age groups. Excess deaths were calculated as the deaths in 2020 over the average deaths in 2016-2019. Age-specific data for Australia and Canada were only available through 2020 weeks 47 and 51, respectively. Excess death data for Japan were not available in the Human Mortality Database. For the country comparison, excess potential years of life lost were calculated by summing the number of excess deaths within each age group. Then, those counts were multiplied by the number of years from the mid-point of the age range up to 75 years. Although averagelife expectancyamong peer countries is higher, from 78.7 years in the U.S. up to 84.2 years in Japan, we used 75 years based on the OECD methodology. Potential remaining years were calculated from 8, 50, and 69.5 years to the age limit for age groups 0-14, 15-64, and 65-74, respectively. U.S. CDCdatashow that weighted average excess death age in the 15-64 age group is 50 years. Because more granular age data for excess deaths were not available in all countries, we used an age of 50 to calculate potential years of life lost to the age limit of 75 for the 15-64 age group for all countries. This decision might make the gap between the U.S. and peer countries smaller as the age at excess death in peer countries might be higher than 50 years. Lastly, excess years of life lost were combined across all age groups for the excess potential years of life lost in each nation. For each country, excess potential years of life lost were calculated per 100,000 people in each country using the 2018 OECD population counts by age groups.",
            "CDC excess deathdataby age groups and week were used to assess excess deaths within age groups and portion of excess deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. CDCdatawere also used for analysis of excess deaths and excess potential years of life lost by race and ethnicity groups in the U.S. in 2020. Excess deaths in 2020 MMWR weeks 1-52 were used for calculation of excess mortality rate by race and ethnicity. For excess potential years of life lost calculation, excess death counts were multiplied by the distance between the mid-point of the age groups to the age limit and summed within each age and race or ethnicity group. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race but are categorized as Hispanic; other groups are non-Hispanic. CDCdataon population counts by age and race or ethnicity were used to standardize premature excess deaths per 100,000 people.",
            "A limitation of this analysis is that the excess potential years of life lost were based on excess deaths by age groups rather than excess deaths at each age. Our results of excess potential years of life lost are similar tootherearlierstudiesof potential years of life lost in the U.S. due to COVID-19. Our estimates of excess potential years of life lost are likely underestimated due to a few reasons. First, although we limited the excess years lost calculation up to age limit of 75, excess deaths above 75 years are also premature deaths by some amount of time; therefore, estimates presented here are likely underestimated for the overall excess potential years of life lost. Second, we incorporated excess life years saved among the youngest ages 0-14 in the overall estimate. Deaths among children ages 0-14 decreased in 2020 in most countries compared to prior years. Earlyreportsindicate deaths due to accidents and influenza have been lower among children due to social distancing and lockdown measures implemented during the pandemic.",

            "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not clear how healthcare utilization and spending would change. Although one might expect health costs to increase during a pandemic, there were otherfactorsdriving spending and utilization down.",
            "In spring of 2020, healthcare use and spending dropped precipitously due to cancellations of elective care to increase hospital capacity and social distancing measures to mitigate community spread of the coronavirus. Althoughtelemedicineuse increased sharply, it was not enough to compensate for the drop in in-person care. As the year progressed, healthcare use and spending began to rebound as in-person care resumed for hospital and lab services and COVID-19 testing became more widely available. However, overall health spending appears to have dropped slightly in 2020, the first time in recorded history.",
            "As of December 2020, health services spending was down about 2.7% (seasonally adjusted annual rates) and it remained suppressed in January 2021. When adding in spending on prescription drugs, total health spending was down by just about 1.5% as of December 2020 compared to the same time in 2019. The U.S. GDP fell by 3.5% by the end of 2020, meaning that, although health spending dropped, it likely represented a larger share of the economy than in past years.",
            "The drop in health spending in 2020 reflects a decrease in utilization for non-COVID medical care. Particularly early in the pandemic, it appears many people delayed or went without medical care they otherwise would have received. Although healthcare use picked up toward the end of the year, it was not enough to compensate for the missed care earlier in the year. Additionally, the cost of COVID-19vaccine administrationwill likely have an upward effect onclaimscosts in 2021, as severalinsurersnoted in their rate filings to state regulators.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "One way to look at health spending is to use the Quarterly Services Survey (QSS) data. Across all health services, which excludes prescription drugs and social services, health services revenue was down by -8.9% in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the second quarter of 2019. In third quarter 2020, health services revenue was up by 0.9% from third quarter 2019. In fourth quarter 2020, health services revenue was up 3.4% relative to the fourth quarter of 2019.",
            "Although spending rebounded at the end of 2020, health services spending was nevertheless down by about 1% in 2020 relative to 2019. The QSS data do not include spending on pharmaceuticals, which, as discussed more below, have been spared from pandemic-related spending drops.",
            "Another way to look at health spending trends is to use the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which is published monthly on an annualized basis. Like the QSS, the BEA’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) data show spending on health services was down sharply in spring 2020. (The monthly figures are estimates, and are later adjusted, in part based on results from the QSS.)",
            "At the nadir in April 2020, personal consumption expenditures on health services (not including pharmaceuticals) were down by -31.9% on an annualized basis. This was unprecedented, as year-over-year personal consumption expenditures on health services have grown every month since the data became available in the 1960s. However, after plummeting in spring 2020, spending on health services has rebounded, and by January 2021, was down just -2.4% from the previous year (seasonally adjusted at annual rates).",
            "The chart above does not include spending on pharmaceuticals and other medical products, which was up 5.0% year-over-year in December 2020, and up 1.0% year-over-year as of January 2021 over the same time the year before. Prescription drug revenue has not suffered from the pandemic the way health services revenue has, as the latter fell largely due to social distancing and the delay or cancellation of elective procedures. Combined spending on health services and prescription drugs was down by -1.53% as of December 2020, and by -2.2% as of January 2021 (seasonally adjusted annual rates, relative to the same month in the prior year).",
            "As of fourth quarter 2020, U.S. GDP was down by -3.5% (seasonally adjusted at annual rates), relative to fourth quarter of 2019. This suggests health spending may represent a somewhat larger share of the economy in 2020 than in past years. The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) are the official source of health spending in the U.S. The NHEA counts a broader set of health-related spending compared to the BEAmethodology. TheNHEAdata showed health spending as a percent of the U.S. economy was 17.7% in2019. The NHEA estimates of health spending as a share of the economy in 2020 will be updated later in the year. Based on BEA data, we estimate health spending as a percent of the U.S. economy might have increased by 0.1 percentage points in 2020.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Through 2020, the Quarterly Services Survey shows that health services spending is down by 1.0% relative to 2019. Ambulatory care settings, like physician offices (-3.8%) and outpatient care centers (-2.7%), saw drops in annual health revenue, while revenue for labs and nursing homes increased and hospital revenue was about flat. Although not shown in this chart, dental providers have seen some of the largest drops in revenue among health services.",
            "As can be seen by clicking on the quarterly revenue tabs in the chart above, revenue for some health service providers has been volatile. For example, spending on medical and diagnostic laboratories was down by -14.5% in the second quarter of 2020, but as COVID-19 testing became more widely available through the year, spending on labs was up by 32.7% in the fourth quarter year-over-year.",
            "Similarly, hospital revenue was down by -5.6% in the second quarter of 2020, with the cancellation ofmany elective procedures, but revenue bounced back in the third and fourth quarters, rising 5.7% over the previous year by fourth quarter 2020. On net, hospital revenue was therefore mostly unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019.",
            "Although social distancing and hospital capacity concerns were key drivers of the drop in health spending in 2020, use of health services may have also been suppressed due to affordability concerns amid the struggling economy.",
            "In the chart above, we compare health spending in the quarter before, the quarter of, and the four quarters following the beginning of a recession based on BEA quarterly data. In previous recessions, except for the 2000s recession, health spending growth slowed down in the quarter following the first quarter of the recession, as compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Following the 2000 recession, year-over-year health spending growth increased from 7% in the quarter before to 9% in the fourth quarter relative to the same quarter in the year before.",
            "Health spending growth hassloweddown in the quarters following the beginning of some recessions. However, the COVID-19 recession marks the first of the past 5 recessions to result in a decrease in health spending growth year-over-year. Health spending was down -18% in the second quarter of 2020 and stayed down at -2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 over the prior year.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "An analysis of hospital utilization data by Epic andKFFfound that while hospitalizations had fallen in the spring of 2020, admissions had picked back up to about 95% of expected utilization (based on historical patterns) by July 2020. After dropping again to 90% of expected admissions by August, overall admissions for the year rebounded to 94% of expected admissions as of December 5, 2020. As these data are only available through early December 2020, it is not yet clear how the latest spike in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 — which resulted in some hospitals again reaching capacity — affected utilization into early 2021.",
            "Although most employer health plans cover telemedicine services, ouranalysis found thattelemedicine uptake before the coronavirus pandemic remained low. In 2018, 2.4% of large group enrollees who had an outpatient office visit had at least one telemedicine visit.",
            "However, with social distancing, changes to provider payment for telehealth, and recommendations to call ahead to providers, telemedicine use has increased with the pandemic, according to analysis by IQVIA. Even so, as the chart above demonstrates, telehealth use was not large enough to fully offset the drop in in-person care. (Earlier analyses fromEpic Health Research Network,FAIR Health, andCVS Healthall show sharp increases in telemedicine use relative to the period before the pandemic.)",
            "The CDC’s data on the utilization of age-appropriate women’s cervical cancer screening among women insured through Kaiser Permanente Southern California shows preventive services utilization rebounded but was considerably below the pre-pandemic levels. During March 19-June 11 of 2020, there was a 78% and 82% drop in cervical cancer screenings for women aged 21-29 years and women aged 30-65 years, respectively, relative to the same time period in 2019. During June 12-Septembre 30 of 2020, preventive services utilization remained 29% and 24% below 2019 levels for aged 21-29 years and women aged 30-65 years, respectively.",
            "According to an analysis of electronic health records byEpic Health Research Network, the average weekly screenings for breast, colon, and cervical cancers dropped 94%, 86%, and 94% during January 20 – April 21, 2020 relative to the averages before January 20, 2020.An analysisby IQVIA found that oncology visits for newly diagnosed cancer patients began to increase in summer, but and had still not reached baseline in October. If cancer cases are missed or patients are diagnosed at later stages, this could have long-term impacts on both health outcomes and costs. Similarpatternscan be seen for other serious and chronic diseases. The sustained decrease in health services utilization, including preventive services, may lead to more serious diagnoses and increased disease burden in the future.",
            "Individual market insurers are required to file detailed premium justifications to state regulators for the coming year. Weanalyzedthese filings to assess the effect COVID-19 will have on 2021 premiums. In their rate filings, most insurers pointed to remaining uncertainty surrounding pent-up demand for delayed or forgone health services in 2020, the costs associated with distributing coronavirus vaccinations, and the direct costs of treating people with COVID-19. Of those insurers that specified a rate impact due to the pandemic, most said the pandemic would have a net-zero effect on their costs in 2021, with some insurers saying they expect costs to drop and others expecting costs to increase. This variation in expectations across insurers illustrates the remaining uncertainty of how the pandemic will continue to affect the U.S. health system in the coming year and beyond.",
            "As the year 2020 progressed, it became clear private health insurers were likelyprofitablefrom the pandemic’s suppressed healthcare spending, and that many insurers would likely owe significant Medical Loss Ratio rebates under the Affordable Care Act. In response, a number of insurers preemptively offered premium relief and voluntarilywaivedcost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment and certain other services.",

            "Note: An updated version of this analysis ishere.",
            "In 2020, COVID-19 became thethird leading cause of deathin the United States, exceeded only by cancer and heart disease. However, that ranking includes months in early 2020 when the pandemic had not fully taken hold in the U.S. The death toll from COVID-19 has risen sharply, particularly since the November and December holidays.",
            "Looking at the most recent data on deaths from COVID-19 and other causes, it becomes clear that COVID-19 is currently the number one cause of death in the United States. As of February 20, 2021, an average of more than 2,400 people per day died of COVID-19 in the U.S. during February 2021. That number is staggering compared to other leading causes of death and is nearly 20% higher than the next leading cause. Heart disease, which is typically the number one cause of death in the U.S. each year, leads to the death of about 2,000 Americans per day, and cancer claims about 1,600 American lives per day. The cumulative count of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the U.S. is 497,648 through February 20, 2021, and is expected to exceed 500,000 in the next few days.",
            "The chart above combines data on COVID-19 mortality rates fromKFF’s trackerwith data fromCenter for Disease Control (CDC)on weekly counts of death by jurisdiction and cause of death. COVID-19 deaths in the chart represent the average daily deaths thus far in February 2021 (as of February 20, 2021). Deaths from other causes represent the weighted daily mortality rate averaged over MMWR weeks 1-52 during the year 2020. This CDC dataset does not include deaths due to accidents (which, before the pandemic, were typically the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer), nor does it include suicides (which were typically the tenth leading cause of death before the pandemic). To avoid double-counting, the dataset excludes deaths confirmed to have an underlying cause of COVID-19. The chart could, however, understate the severity of COVID-19 because some of those deaths may have been misclassified as other causes. There were many more deaths in 2020 than expected, and confirmed COVID-19 cases only accounted for about two in threeexcess deaths.",
            "The current wave of COVID-19 has been described as more of a tsunami. The 3,076 COVID-19 deaths per day in January 2021 represent a29% increaseover December. December 2020 may have been the first month in which the COVID-19 mortality rate exceeded that of heart disease, though the margin is narrow and that data may still be preliminary due to reporting delays. In January 2021, the number of deaths from COVID-19 increased so rapidly that it has clearly become the number one cause of death in the U.S. These data are just one more way of illustrating the urgency of expediting COVID-19 vaccination. President Biden has developed a plan to increase vaccine supply, including through use of the Defense Production Act and by purchasing additional doses. In the meantime, other public health measures are crucial to reduce transmission. The number of new COVID-19 cases appears to have taken a turn for the better in the latter half of January, which could lead to declines in the number of new deaths several weeks from now. However, it is difficult to know what the future holds, particularly with the potential spread of new variants.",

            "The initial roll out of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States has been mired withdistributionchallenges. State and local governments, health systems, and other providers have at many times faced shortages and other times been left with unused vaccines. One of the vaccines authorized thus far, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, has specific storage requirements, which also creates challenges for some locations. Priority groupseligibleto get vaccinated have found the process difficult to navigate. Communication between federal and local officials might have improved recently, but vaccine supply bottlenecks remain and racial disparities in access have emerged. Understanding where adults got vaccinated before the pandemic can inform the massive state and federaleffortsto vaccinate Americans against COVID-19. Accessibility of vaccination locations is one component that will influence equity in COVID-19vaccinationrates.",
            "Where vaccinations are provided may also affect payers’ costs for COVID-19 vaccine administration. The federal government centrally pre-paid for COVID-19 vaccine doses but some of the costs of administering the vaccines will fall on payers. Whether vaccine recipients are insured through a private insurer or a public program, or are uninsured, they will face noout-of-pocketcosts for the vaccine or its administration. For the near future, providers will receive COVID-19 vaccines from the federal government at no cost. Providers will, however, often bill public and private payers for the cost of administering the vaccines (i.e., the cost of paying staff to give the shot). Insurers are then required to pay for the charges of administering the vaccine without imposing cost-sharing. For out-of-networkproviders, CMS has suggested payers use a reasonable payment rate, or the Medicare payment amount. Providers are able to use theCOVIDProvider Relief Funds to cover vaccine administration costs for uninsured patients, as well as any excess costs not fully reimbursed by payers. The cost of COVID-19 vaccine administration will likely have an upward effect onclaimscosts in 2021, as severalinsurersnoted in their rate filings to state regulators.",
            "In early April 2022, the U.S. federal government will run out offundsto pay for COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine administration costs foruninsuredandunderinsuredpeople.",
            "This brief shows where Americans typically get flu vaccines in the U.S. and how much it costs to administer flu and other vaccines using data from past years. We use 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data on where adults typically get flu shots, and 2018 MarketScan data for administration costs of flu and other vaccines among non-elderly adults with employer coverage. Where and how many adults get the COVID-19 vaccine is going to be different than forflubecause COVID-19 is more serious and COVID-19 vaccine doses are more limited. We focus on flu vaccine location because flu vaccines are recommended to almost everyone and given to a large share of the population each year. Understanding how Americans access flu vaccines can inform policymakers about which sites may be effective for reaching people for COVID-19 vaccinations, particularly as distribution points increase. We focus on adults because children have specific vaccine regimens and differ from adults as to where they get vaccines. Additionally, COVID-19 vaccines are thus far onlyauthorizedfor ages over 16 (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine) and over 18 (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine).",

            "About half of American adults reported getting a flu shot during the2019-2020flu season with differences in uptake across a variety of demographic groups. In 2018 survey data (BRFSS does not collect flu shot location data for each year), most adults reported getting a flu shot at a doctor’s office (40%) or a retail pharmacy or store health clinic (26.1%). The remaining adults who reported getting a flu shot received it through their workplace or school (13.6%), through a public health department clinic or community health center (10.6%), or at a hospital (7.3%).",
            "Because some in-person workplaces and schools have been closed due to social distancing recommendations, federal and local officials will need to consider how to get COVID-19 vaccines to those who would have generally gotten vaccinated at workplaces or schools.  Schools and other community sites can be used as mass vaccination sites as well.",
            "Across racial and ethnic groups, most adults reported receiving a flu vaccine at a doctor’s office. Retail health clinics were also a primary vaccination site for White adults, with 30% receiving their flu vaccine through a retail pharmacy or store. In contrast, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian or Alaska Native adults were all less likely than White adults to receive a flu vaccine at a retail health clinic. Compared to White adults, a higher share of Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native adults reported getting a flu vaccine at a public health department, clinic, or community health center.",
            "KFFanalysishas raised early concerns about racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccinations. The findings in this analysis suggest that as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available, decisions about where people can access the vaccine will have implications for racial equity. Specifically, the data suggest that distribution through retail pharmacies may disadvantage people of color since they have been less likely to use retail clinics as a location to get flu shots. In contrast, making the vaccine available through doctors’ offices and health departments, clinics, and community health centers may facilitate access for people of color given that these have been the primary sites through which they receive their flu vaccination. Moreover, other KFF researchshows that health care providers are a top source that people say they will turn to for help with vaccine decision-making across racial and ethnic groups.",

            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "While most adults received the flu shot through a doctor’s office or a retail clinic, almost one in four (24%) adults insured through their employers reported receiving the flu vaccine at their workplace or school. Less than 5% of adults insured through Medicaid, Medicare, or non-group insurance reported getting flu shots through their workplaces or schools. A higher share of individuals covered by Medicare and Medicaid went to a doctor’s office to receive their vaccination.",
            "Particularly early on in the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, Americans will end up getting the COVID-19 vaccine where they are able to, based more on how localities funnel vaccination doses than on their source of insurance. However, in the long run, when vaccinations become more widely available, insurance type, which is correlated with theusualsource of care, may play a bigger role in where Americans go to get the COVID-19 vaccine.",
            "The federal government has stated the COVID-19 vaccines will be available to Americans at zero cost, regardless of their insurance status. Where people end up receiving the vaccine (e.g., at a doctor’s office vs. a mass vaccination site) may affect whether their insurance is billed for the cost of administering the dose.",
            "With millions of doses being administered, administration costs will add up. Some COVID vaccines include a two-dose schedule. While the cost of administering other vaccines might not be perfectly analogous, it could give a general idea of how much administering each individual dose might cost.",
            "This chart shows the cost of administering all adult vaccines. We did not limit this chart to only flu shots because insurers’ payments to providers for administering a shot are similar regardless of the vaccine.",
            "Among non-elderly adults with private health insurance through a large employer, plan payments for administering a vaccine at a doctor’s office ranged from $13 at the 10thpercentile to $48 at the 90thpercentile with a median payment of $25 in 2018. This suggests that COVID vaccines with two doses will likely cost private insurers around $50 to administer per person in sum.",
            "Medicarewas previously paying providers $28.39 for administering a COVID-19 vaccine requiring a single dose, which is similar to the $25 private insurers typically pay per vaccine administered. Since the end of 2021, Medicare has been paying providers $40 per vaccine shot administered for most patients. Additionally,CMShas said the Provider Relief Fund can be used to cover COVID vaccine administration costs in excess of payer reimbursements and for uninsured patients.",

            "After the U.S. federalgovernmentruns out of funds that covered the cost of vaccine administration on April 5, 2022, uninsured and underinsured people may be charged for COVID-19 vaccine administration at a rate similar to those charged for Medicare. Vaccine administration costs are required to be covered by the insurer or payer for other publicly or privately insured people.",
            "Where people are able to access the COVID-19 vaccine will have important implications for access and equity. Among Americans who got a flu vaccine, most adults got it at a doctor’s office or retail clinic (pharmacy or store). However, a greater share of Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native adults reported getting a flu shot at a local health department, clinic, or community health center than the share of White adults. Additionally, a lower share of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American Indian or Alaska Native adults reported getting a flu shot at a retail clinic than the share of White adults.",
            "COVID-19 vaccine rollout began with vaccines initially being provided at hospitals and long-term care facilities. As states and localities continue to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine to broader groups of the population, additional sites and locations have been designated. The Biden Administration’s COVID-19 relief plan includes increasing the number of vaccine administrators and vaccination sites. Building on partnerships initiated during the Trump Administration, the Biden Administrationisactivating pharmacy partnerships to allow those eligible to get vaccinated at local pharmacies starting on February 11. The Biden Administration has also recently announced partnering with community healthcenters. Some cities have begun using mass vaccination sites (e.g., athletic stadiums) to administer the vaccine. The reach and equity of COVID-19 vaccination efforts could be improved by providing COVID vaccines at community locations that people trust, such as, community health departments or clinics, community recreation centers, places of worship, and local schools.",
            "While the federal government will distribute COVID-19 vaccines to states and providers at no cost, providers may bill public and private insurers for the cost of administering the vaccines. Our analysis of large employer plans’ payments for flu and other vaccines shows that the typical cost of administering vaccines in private plans is similar to the rate Medicare plans to pay providers for administering the COVID-19 vaccine. Although there is still some uncertainty about how the cost of administering the vaccine will be spread across state and local governments and private insurers, individuals will receiveCOVIDvaccines at no cost to them. In many cases, health plans will have to pay providers for the cost of administering each vaccine, which, depending on the vaccination rate and timing, could have an effect on premiums next year. However, premiums for this year have generally been set by private insurers and employers.",
            "",
            "The 2018 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data were used to assess how many adults received the vaccine (FLUSHOT6) and where they received the flu vaccine (IMFVPLAC) in the prior 12-months. BRFSS is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of non-institutionalized civilian adults aged 18 years and older. Guam and Puerto Rico were excluded. Place of flu vaccine for adults is collected in BRFSS every 3rdyear, and therefore, the most recent survey year with data on flu vaccine location, 2018, was used for this analysis. In the analysis by race or ethnicity, persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race but are categorized as Hispanic; all other groups are non-Hispanic. One limitation of using self-reported data is there may be differences in how people describe getting the flu shot. For example, it is possible survey respondents referred to a health department, clinic, or community center as a doctor’s office – or vice versa.",

MarketScan contains claims data for those enrolled in large employer-sponsored plans. Those receiving vaccines other than in office-based settings were excluded. We estimated the cost of vaccine administration (procedure codes: 90460, 90461, 90471 through 90474, G0008, G0009, G0010) on days with a claim for one of several vaccines (including influenza (flu), hepatitis A and B, and others).

            "In the final months of the Trump Administration, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) releasedfinal rulesestablishing price transparency requirements for healthcare services. Generally, health insurance companies and healthcare providers negotiate prices for services and products. These negotiated prices have typically not been publicly available, meaning that patients often do not know how much they will be charged until after they receive care and the associated bills. As of January 1, 2021, hospitals are required to make payer-negotiated rates for common services available to consumers on an online tool, and for all services in a machine-readable file. A second rule requires insurers in the individual and group markets and self-funded employer plans to make rates and individualized cost-sharing estimates for certain common services available to enrollees by January 1, 2023, and for all services by the following year. However, ongoing litigation challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the price transparency rule aimed at hospitals could affect the implementation and impact of these new rules. President-elect Biden expressed support for greater healthcare price transparency during the campaign, but has not commented specifically on the Trump Administration regulations.",
            "This brief summarizes the key requirements for hospitals, insurers, and self-funded employer plans under the new price transparency rules. We then analyze price variation for select health services covered under these rules. We examine prices specifically for health services that are fairly standard and often planned, meaning that patients could theoretically shop for care in advance. Overall, we find that the prices of select services — i.e., knee and hip replacements, cholesterol tests, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) — vary widely even within a given geographical region. In the brief, we also discuss the implications of the new rules for patients and the market. While the evidence shows that price transparency might not reduce cost, the new rules could shine a greater light on where health care costs are particularly high, helping to inform policy.",
            "Prices for routine healthcare services can vary across the U.S. and even within a given region. Advocates of price transparency argue that it will lower consumer health costs by increasing competition among providers and giving patients the option of “shopping” for the best price. While the federal government and states set reimbursement rates for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, there is generally no price regulation in the private insurance market. The notable exception is Maryland where the state sets hospital rates for all payers. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires that hospitals publish a list of standard charges for all given services, which are the unnegotiated, undiscounted rates for services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS)price transparency rulesdraw on the legal authority established under the ACA and interpret its transparency requirement to include payer-negotiated rates.",
            "The latest final rule requires that insurers in the individual and group markets and self-funded employer plans provide enrollees with price and cost-sharing information for covered health services in non-grandfathered plans. The first requirement in this rule to take effect requires that insurers and plans make public the following detailed price information in three separate “machine-readable files” by January 1, 2022, with monthly updates: 1) negotiated rates for all covered items and services between the plan and in-networks providers; 2) historical payments and billed charges from out-of-network providers; 3) in-network negotiated rates and historical net prices for all covered prescription drugs at the pharmacy location level. Insurers must make this pricing information and personalized cost-sharing estimates ( i.e. deductible payments, co-pays, and coinsurance) available to enrollees on an online consumer-usable tool for 500 “shoppable” services by January 1, 2023, and then for the remainder of all covered serviced and items by January 1, 2024. The 500 common “shoppable” services are identified in the rule by HHS, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Treasury. State insurance regulators will oversee enforcement of the transparency rule for fully insured plans, the Department of Labor will oversee group plans subject to ERISA, the Treasury will oversee church plans, HHS will oversee non-Federal governmental plans, and the Office of Personnel Management will oversee the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plans.",
            "The final rule builds on the Trump Administration’s initial price transparencyrulerequiringhospitalsto publish descriptions and standard, discounted, and payer-negotiated rates for at least 300 common medical services – 70 identified by CMS and 230 that can be selected by the hospital – to the public in a “consumer-friendly manner.” Additionally, hospitals are required to provide data on standard, discount and negotiated rates for all offered items and services on their website, in a machine-readable format. CMS retains enforcement authority, and the process for assessing hospital compliance could be triggered by complaints to CMS or hospital system audits. Hospitals that do not comply after January 1, 2021 may face a fine of up to $300 per day.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Insurersand hospitals generally oppose the new rules. The American Hospital Association and other groups sued HHSarguingthat the rule “exceeds the agency’s statutory authority, violates the First Amendment, and is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.” A federal court dismissed the plaintiff’s motion, and ruled in favor of HHS; the case is beingappealed. Another case currently before the Supreme Court,California v. Texas, could also affect the transparency rule. This case seeks to overturn the entire ACA; depending on the outcome, HHS could lose the statutory authority under the ACA to require hospitals and private payers to publish prices for health services, and new legislation would be required to pass through Congress before price transparency regulations could be enforced.",
            "Certain health services may be better suited for price transparency efforts. For instance, emergency, specialty, or complex care are harder to anticipate and shop for given the varying complexity in care and time and potential limitations to specialized providers. Price transparency tools are more suited for health services that can be scheduled in advance and are relatively standardized procedures. We selected three such services – joint replacements, MRIs, and cholesterol tests – the prices for which must be made public for patients under the HHS’ transparency rules. We analyzed prices for these health services across 20 large core-based statistical areas (MSAs) using IBM’s MarketScan®Commercial Claims and Encounters Database of large employer claims in order to examine the extent to which prices vary for a given service. In this analysis,price refers to theallowed charges, which is the amount paid under the plan for a given service, including both the plan’s and the enrollee’s share but excluding any balance billing.",
            "A limitation of these data is that they reflect cost sharing incurred under the plan and do not includebalance billsthat beneficiaries may receive from out-of-network providers for care. Enrollees typically pay less in cost-sharing for in-network services, which are performed by providers who have agreed to a contracted rate with the plan. Additionally, we are comparing variation in average allowed charges, without any adjustment for the quality or intensity of care provided. For more information see the methods section.",
            "As shown below, prices for a common surgical procedure, imaging test, and cholesterol test all share one thing in common: they vary widely.",
            "Knee and hip replacements are common surgical procedures. The average price (allowed charge) of a joint replacement for knee or hip surgery in an in-network facility varies widely across the country. The price includes in-network room and board and allowed charges for the procedure, but excludes any balanced billing that may occur if the providing clinicians were out-of-network. The average price in the New York metro area ($58,193) is more than double the average price in the Baltimore, MD region ($23,170).",
            "The price of knee and hip replacements also varieswithina region. The Baltimore region had the lowest average price for inpatient joint replacements and had relatively small variation within the region, possibly because inpatient hospital services are subject to the state’s all-payer rate setting system.",
            "The analysis shows that in some areas, patients may face widely varying prices based on the hospital and their insurance plan, even within a given MSA.",
            "Lipid panels are routine screening tests to measure cholesterol levels in the blood. The average price for an in-network lipid panel in an outpatient setting allowed by large employer plans in the Oakland, CA area ($30) is 3 times higher than in the Orlando, FL area ($10). Even within the Oakland area, a quarter of panels were above $54, while a quarter were below $11. In the case of lipid panels, higher price areas like Oakland tend to have wider variation than lower-price areas like Orlando. In most of the MSAs shown, the average price of a lipid panel in an outpatient setting allowed by large employer plans ranged between $10-15.",
            "We examined the price of a lower back MRI performed in a physician office. The average price of this type of MRI allowed by large employer plans was 144% higher in Oakland, CA region ($853) than in the Orlando, FL region ($349). These prices include out-of-network providers, but do not include any balance billing incurred by the patient.",
            "Prices allowed by large employer plans also vary within regions. For example, in the Minneapolis region, half of MRI claims were priced between $550 and $900, In the Phoenix region, however, that range was much smaller, with prices for half of MRIs falling between $355 and $478.",
            "Proponents of price transparency initiativesarguethat by making prices public, health systems will face pressure to lower prices to compete for consumers shopping for health services, and insurers will face greater pressure to negotiate discounts. While there is general agreement that patients should have access to information about what they will be charged for care, some experts disagree on whether the mechanism of transparency is an effective tool to curb rising costs.",
            "Some price transparency initiatives have found modest decreases in health costs. Astudyof New Hampshire’s statewide online price transparency database found that the total cost of medical imaging procedures decreased by 3% over a five-year period, and both insurers and consumers (particularly those with a deductible) experienced savings. Anotherstudyin 2014 of an employer-sponsored price transparency platform was associated with lower spending for common procedures.",
            "Perhaps counterintuitively, price transparency could also lead to increased prices, an outcome experienced inotherindustries. As health systems and provider groups are made aware of what other providers are charging for the same care, providers could try to negotiate higher rates to match their competitors, especially in more highly concentrated markets. Studies show that existing price transparency tools are not associated with decreases in spending. A study of two large employers published in JAMA in 2016 found that offering a tool for employees was not associated with decreased patient outpatient out-of-pocket spending. Similarly, in Massachusetts – a state that requires payers to have cost estimator tools for patients to estimate cost for services at various sites of care – evidence did not show that the tools were associated with decreased spending.",
            "The cost of implementing price transparency tools can be quite expensive for employers and insurers. While some employers and insurers already provide enrollees with estimates of potential cost, the requirement for real-time data on individual cost-sharing requires more advanced technical input, management, and compliance. In the latest final rule, the federal government estimates that while insurers and enrollees could save $154 million in reduced medical costs, the three-year average annual burden and cost of implementation of the rule will range between $5.7 billion to $7.9 billion for insurers. Additionally, the federal government estimates that the rule will contribute to higher premiums in the individual market, potentially harming individuals who do not receive subsidies in the marketplace.",
            "There are many factors that play into whether patients will be able to make informed choices based on price transparency data. Patients must first be made aware of the availability of price information tools for non-emergency services. Even then, patients may have to make decisions based on their cost-sharing liability and who is in their provider network; for example, patients might not be able to access higher value care if the lower-priced providers are not in-network.",
            "Anumber of statesrequire information on pricing to be made available to patients. Some insurers and employers also have tools making price information more accessible for enrollees. However, evidence suggests that most individualsdo not seekpricing information even when tools are available, and when they do, mostdo not compareproviders. Patients report difficulty in obtaining price information and a desire to keep their providers as barriers to shopping for care. In Massachusetts – a state that implemented an online-tool for patients to compare costs for health services across providers –78% of surveyedconsumers stated that they’d like to know the cost of care before obtaining it, but over half (54%) of individuals were unaware of the existing price comparison tool.",
            "Much of health spending occurs unexpectedly in a medical crisis or emergency like a heart attack or stroke, and there is limited evidence on how many services can actually be shopped for in advance. Some estimates find that roughly30% to40%of health spending was for services that could be scheduled in advance. These two estimates define health services and products as shoppable if they can be scheduled in advance, if there is price information available to the patient, and if there are two or more places through which the individual could receive the service or product (i.e., there is competition in the market).",
            "Even if patients have shopped and planned for specific services, they may need additional medical services that were not accounted for in their original estimate. For example, a screening medical service may become diagnostic during the procedure, and additional services or tests may result in unexpected medical bills. CMS’s price transparency rules requires services that are generally packaged together have one price for the service and ancillary fees – such as room and board, facility fees – but this might not include provider fees. While insurers are now required to provide historical estimates of out-of-network prices and billed charges under the new rule, those estimates could vary significantly from what a patient faces.",
            "Patients contribute to the cost of the healthcare they use through cost-sharing such as co-payments, co-insurances, and deductibles. A patient’s cost-sharing may vary across covered benefits, the provider they select and other plan provisions. The new rule requires insurers and plans to tailor cost-sharing information to each individual’s health insurance plan structure. However, there may still be challenges in getting accurate real-time information on out-of-pocket estimates, since the amount a patient may owe under their deductible depends on if they have received other services and whether those services have been accounted for at the time they are using the transparency tool. For example, a patient will not face additional cost-sharing for in-network services if they have met their out-of-pocket maximum, but if the online price transparency tool is not up to date with an enrollees other spending cost-sharing estimate will be much higher than what is actually required.",
            "Patients may want to factor in the quality of care along with the price of care when seeking health services. Current federal price transparency requirements do not require reporting on quality alongside price. There is debate onhowto factor in quality of care into pricing, since higher prices do not necessarilycorrelatewith improved quality of care or outcomes. Additionally, quality can be difficult to measure and compare across providers, andquality metricsmight not capture the characteristics of providers that patients may be interested in. For example, common quality metrics at the hospital level include mortality rates, cesarean sections, or hospital re-admissions. Such metrics, while important, might not be the most relevant for patients shopping for certain non-emergency services. In the absence of usable quality information, patients might perceive a higher price as being an indicator of higher quality.",
            "Prices for common health services vary widely across regions and within regions. There is general consensus that patients should have access to the cost of care prior to receiving that care. The new price transparency rule aims to make that price and out-of-pocket cost information available to patients. Yet whether this information will help patients access lower-priced care depends on a variety of factors, including the type of care patients need, the choices available within a given network, and, perhaps most importantly, how providers, purchasers, and payers respond to increased price transparency. The availability of price information could alter the dynamics of negotiations between providers and insurers by allowing each to see what their competition charges and pays, respectively. Insurers and large employers may be able to utilize the information to configure their networks to include lower-priced providers. Alternatively, lower-priced providers could demand higher prices. Overall, it is unclear whether transparency will lead to decreased prices or consumer savings. However, greater transparency could shine a spotlight on the cost of health care generally in the U.S. and on specific providers or communities where prices are especially high, helping to galvanize and inform future policy action.",
            "We analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2018 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. This analysis used claims for 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population. Survey for enrollees at firms of one thousand or more workers by sex, age and, state. Claims for people age 65 and over and from Puerto Rico were excluded. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range. We did not control for differences in quality, intensity or health risk of individuals accessing services.",
            "This analysis examines allowed charges, which represent the total billed amounts, including both the plan and enrollees’ share, minus any balancing billing. Both in- and out-of-network claims were analyzed, except when directly noted that only in-network claims were included. In determining allowed charges, we excluded claims that were very high or unreasonably low.",
            "MSAs and population counts are defined by the US Census Bureau. Most MSAs are Metropolitan Statistical Areas, but some of the largest areas (Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington) are subdivided and reported at the Metropolitan Division Level.",
            "MRI: Outpatient MRIs include the cost of outpatient claims with a CPT code of 72148, a lumbar spine MRI. The cost of an MRI may be split between professional charges, facility fees and the technician charges. In order to ensure that we were capturing the cost of the MRI, and not just the technicians’ time or facility fee, we only selected some days which include an MRI charge that had both a professional and facility fee with a CPT code of 72148, days with at least one professional fee without a procedure modifier of 26 or TC and days where all of the professional claims had a CPT code of 72148 (and the facility fees did not have another CPT code). Observations below $100 or above the 99.5th percentile were excluded.  We consider MRI’s which took place at an office, independent clinic or out-patient not elsewhere classified as taking place in an office visits. Only MSAs with more than 500 unweighted observations are reported. Charges include a small percentage of out-of-network visits. A limitation of these data is that they reflect cost sharing incurred under the benefit plan and do not include balance-billing payments that beneficiaries may make to providers for out-of-network services.",
            "Lipid Panel: Lipid Panels are claims with a CPT code of 80061. This does not include the venipuncture or other lab work that may be performed. Two percent of cases were out-of-network and were excluded.  Observations were limited to lipid panels billed from doctor’s office, health clinic, or independent laboratories. Lipid panels performed at hospital tend to be more expensive and were excluded. Claims were also trimmed below $5 and above the 99.5% percentile. Estimates are not reported for MSAs with fewer than 1,500 observations.",
            "Joint Replacement: In-network admissions were defined as admissions that included exclusively in-network room and board charges. Roughly 90% of all admissions met these criteria, but some may include other out-of-network charges. Admissions were classified as joint replacement when the associated diagnosis-related group (DRG) was 470, “major hip and knee joint replacement or reattachment of lower extremity without major complications”. Results are only reported for MSAs with more than 125 unweighted observations. We did not control for the cost of comorbidities, or other factors which may increase the cost of the admission; 96% of admissions are three or fewer days. In addition, the cost of an admission was trimmed below $500 and above the 99.5% percentile.",

            "Social distancing recommendations have led many health providers to increasingly deliver care through telehealth services. The precipitous increase in telehealth is in contrast to the year prior to the pandemic when relatively few enrolleesutilized telehealthservices. There has been tremendous interest from health care providers, regulators, and employers on how to meet the needs of patients despite disruptions arising from the pandemic. Telehealth encompasses a broad range of provider-patient communication through online portals, and audio- or video-enabled tools. Our prioranalysissurveyed some of the policy and patient-level considerations that are influencing how telehealth is being adopted.",
            "Thus far into the pandemic, governments and payers have attempted to increase access to telehealth through regulatory and payment changes. For example,Medicarebegan reimbursing for telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage increased utilization of telehealth. For the duration of the pandemic, Medicare is also reimbursing audio-only services for individuals in remote areas and without access to internet for video communication. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have also incentivized private payers to cover telehealth services during the pandemic through other payment programs, such as the risk adjustmentprogramfor the individual and small group markets.",
            "Beyond changes to payment and reimbursement policy, the continued use and expansion of telehealth services will depend on patients’ familiarity with the technology, their access to the internet, and how the availability of telehealth services is communicated to enrollees. This brief uses data from the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) to estimate how many individuals in the U.S. had access to the internet at home in 2019. While households without internet access may have acquired access during the course of the last year, internet access prior to 2020 is suggestive of some of the disparities in individuals’ access to communication technology and might inform discussions on extending the availability of telehealth services.",
            "25 million (8%) people in the U.S. did not have internet access at home in 2019. Across all households, 78% of Americans had access to broadband including satellite, cable, fiber optic, or DSL service connection at home. 14 million people did not have equipment capable of playing video, such as a laptop, pc computer, smartphone, tablet, or other device.",
            "A larger share of Hispanic and Black Americans did not have access to the internet at home. There were also significant differences by age, with 28% of Black seniors and 24% of Hispanics seniors lacking internet access at home (compared to 18% of all seniors).",
            "There were large disparities in the percent of people without internet access at home by age. Just 5% percent of people under age 55 lacked access to the internet at home in 2019. A higher share of older age groups did not have access to the internet. Among those ages 65 and over, almost 1 in 5 did not have internet access at home. That large shares of older adults lack access to telehealth services during the pandemic is concerning because older adults are at ahigher riskof adverse events due to a COVID-19 infection, and also more likely to need medical services generally.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Almost 1 in 5 people with incomes below the federal poverty level (FPL) lacked internet access at home in 2019— a rate substantially higher than that of higher income Americans.",
            "A higher share of people covered by public insurance programs like Medicaid or Medicare lack internet access than those insured through employers or direct purchase (individual market) plans. In all, almost 1 in 3 Americans who lack internet access at home are covered by Medicare, and a similar share are covered by Medicaid.",
            "As one might expect, internet access is more prevalent in metropolitan areas than non-metro areas with close to twice the share of the population not having access to the internet at home in non-metro areas.",
            "The social distancing measures implemented during COVID-19 have required many health services to be offered virtually rather than in-person. For telehealth services, internet access can be critical. However, 2019 data suggest a significant portion of Americans might not have internet access at home. Disparities in internet access across the populations may pose additional health care access concerns during the pandemic. That lack of internet access is most prevalent in rural areas and among historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups is concerning, as this could worsen existing health care disparities. Additionally, elderly Americans may especially require access to health care services virtually while in-person care is being deferred because the elderly are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if infected with COVID-19 and are generally more likely to need medical services. However, nearly 20% of elderly Americans do not have internet access.",
            "This chart collection is based on KFF’s analysis of the 2019 American Community Survey (ACS), 1-year file. The ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population. We excluded people living in noninstitutional group quarters such as college dormitories and residential treatment centers.",
            "The ACS asks: “At this house, apartment, or mobile home – do you or any member of this household have access to the Internet?” Those who reported having internet service, with or without paying a cell phone company or internet service provider, were categorized as having access to the internet. For more information on the ACS survey questions on internet access, seehere. For information on how measures of internet access may vary, seehere.",
            "We note that the share of the non-institutionalized population in the U.S. without access to the internet at home or without video-capable equipment has steadily decreased between 2016 and 2019. The share of those without access to the internet decreased by three percentage points from 11% of the population to 8% from 2016-2019. Similarly, the share of those without video-capable equipment decreased by 3% percentage points, from 7% to 4% of people. So, the share of population without access to the internet at home has likely decreased in 2020 but a substantial portion of the non-institutionalized population in the U.S. likely continues to lack access to the internet at home in 2020.",

            "In this brief and the accompanyingHealth System Dashboard, we look across over a hundred data points to assess the performance of the health system in the United States. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has upended lives and economies and fundamentally challenged health systems across the globe. At the time of this publication, the U.S. leads in the total number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 and has a higher per capita death rate than many similarly wealthy countries (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) nations with above median gross domestic product (GDP) and median GDP per capita).",
            "COVID-19 is now thethird leadingcause of death in the U.S., but that is not the case in many similarly wealthy countries. Before the pandemic,mortalityanddisease burdenrates were already worse in the U.S. than in peer countries. Because the U.S. has one of the highest rates of all-causeexcess mortalityin 2020 among this group of similar countries, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely widen the gap in health outcomes between the U.S. and its peers. Further, communities of color in the U.S. face a disproportionate impact from COVID-19. Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans have thehighest ratesof death from COVID-19, indicating the pandemic will also worsen health disparities.",
            "The unmitigated spread of COVID-19 has further exposed gaps in the U.S. health system. A surge in cases has strained hospital capacity in hotspot regions throughout the U.S. To better allocate healthcareresourcesand attempt to contain community spread of the virus, routine or non-essential health services were generally cancelled or postponed early in the pandemic. These changes contributed to historic declines in health servicesrevenueandemployment. Before the pandemic, the U.S. already lagged behind peer countries across a number of measures ofhealth system resources, including in the number of hospitals, acute care beds, and hospital healthcare workers.",
            "With plunging demand for non-COVID care in the spring of 2020, health service providers experienced historicdeclinesin revenue in the U.S. At its low point in April, annualized spending on health services had fallen by 32%. Total health services revenue began to rebound in the summer and fall compared to earlier in the pandemic, driven mostly by resumed hospitalizations and increased COVID-19 testing at laboratories. Year-to-date spending on health services is down by about 2% in 2020 relative to the same time in 2019. Adding in prescription drug revenue, which has increased in 2020 over last year, total healthspendingis down by about 0.5% on an annualized basis, as of October. Meanwhile, the U.S. GDP has fallen by 1.8% as of the third quarter, suggesting that, despite falling as well, health spending may represent a somewhat larger share of the economy in 2020 than it did in 2019.",
            "The decline in health spending reflects forgone and delayed medical care, which could have long-term implications for health outcomes and costs. Rates of cancer screenings abruptlydroppedearly on in the pandemic, and office visits for newly diagnosed cancer patients have not returned to baseline levels thus far. In November 2020, about one in four people (24%) reported that, due to the pandemic, theydid not get needed medical carefor something unrelated to the coronavirus.",

            "Time will tell how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected costs, quality, and outcomes in the U.S. health system. Most of the data we track to assess the functioning of the health system lag by one to two years, and we still do not have a complete understanding of how the post-pandemic economy has affected the uninsured rate (though it appears to have not changedmuch). Based on data available through 2019 or earlier years, the following findings highlight recent trends across 10 key indicators of health system performance and outline potential effects of the pandemic and economic downturn. Where possible, we compare trends in the U.S. and similarly wealthy countries.Visit the Health System Dashboardfor more in-depth exploration of these and other telling analyses.",
            "1. COVID-19 reached the third leadingcause of deathin the U.S. in 2020, and will almost surely shorten life expectancy in the U.S. and in other hard-hit countries.Life expectancyin the U.S. had increased by 5 years over the past 4 decades, although there have been declines in recent years driven by increased mortality rates fromcertain causesincluding drug overdoses and suicides. On average, people in comparable countries have a life expectancy of 82.4 years – nearly four years longer than the U.S. life expectancy of 78.7 years – and the gap could grow. As ourearlier analysisfound, the pandemic has caused a widening gap in mortality rates between the U.S. and its peers. The pandemic has also exacerbated racial inequalities in health outcomes. Black, Hispanic, and Native American and Native Alaskan populations in the U.S. are roughly 5 times as likely as White people to behospitalizeddue to COVID-19. They are also more likely todie from COVID-19compared to White people.",
            "2.Disease burden, a measure that accounts for both longevity and quality of life, had generally improved over the past quarter century, with particular improvement for circulatory diseases. However, in the past few years, disease burden has worsened in the U.S. (driven by substance use disorders and an uptick in injuries) while continuing to improve in similar countries. Although disease burden is likely to increase in all countries due to the pandemic, length of life may decrease more in the U.S. than in peer countries. Not only has the U.S. had higher excess deaths and cases from the coronavirus, it also has moreexcess deathsamong younger people than peer countries.Premature deathswere already higher in the U.S. compared to peer countries, and the pandemic will likely increase this disparity. Additionally, the U.S. has relatively high rates of disease burden attributable to some of the health conditions that put people at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19: cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. The pandemic has also raised concerns about long-term mental health outcomes, as an unprecedented share of U.S. adults (43% as of November 2020) have reported experiencingsymptoms of anxiety and/or depressionsince the crisis began. Prior to the pandemic, disease burden due to mental health and substance use disorders combined (4,374 DALYs per 100,000) alreadywell surpasseddisease burden due to any other health condition.",
            "3. The pandemic led to a historic decline inhealth spending. As of October 2020, spending on health services and prescription drugs was down 0.5% from 2019, on an annualized basis. Any drop in health spending is historic, but health costs remain high. Per personhealth spendingwas $11,172 in 2018, about double that of peer countries. This spending differential is primarily because ofhigher pricesfor healthcare in the U.S., asutilizationis similar – and in some cases lower – in the U.S. For the last decade, however, per capita spending in the U.S. has grown at an average rate of 3.6% per year, which issimilarto that of comparable countries.",
            "4. With GDP declining by 1.8% as of the third quarter of 2020 (on an annualized basis) and spending on health services and prescription drugs spending falling about0.5%as of October 2020 (also on an annualized basis), it appears that health spending may represent a somewhat larger share of the economy in 2020 than it did in 2019. Health spending has historicallygrown faster than the economy, but the difference has moderated in recent years. The U.S. health consumption expenditures accounted for18% of GDPin 2018 – much more than comparable countries, where health spending averages 10% of GDP.",
            "5. The pandemic has caused tremendous healthcare access problems in the U.S. In November 2020, 24% of adults reported that because of the pandemic, they didnot getneeded medical care for something other than coronavirus. Telemedicineusehas substantially increased and offset some of the drop in in-person care, but not enough to return to normal levels of care.",
            "6. Pandemic-related job losses threaten to increase the number of people uninsured in the U.S., as people may lose or have lost their job-based health coverage. However, reliable data on the uninsured rate in 2020 is not yet available.Early datado not indicate large drops in employer coverage as of mid-year, suggesting many employers may have kept furloughed workers covered, at least temporarily. Prior to the pandemic,health coveragerates increased in the U.S. under the Affordable Care Act. The uninsured rate among the non-elderly adults was10.9% in the U.S.in 2019. The U.S. coverage rate is still the lowest among comparable countries, all of which have universal coverage.",
            "7. Before the pandemic, there had been improvements in the share of Americans reportingproblems paying medical bills. From 2011 to 2018, the share of people reporting difficulty paying medical bills dropped by more than a quarter. Still, in 2019, 15% of non-elderly adults reported having difficulty paying medical bills, and over half of adults worried about their ability to pay medical bills if they were to get sick or have an accident. Legislation early in the pandemic madeCOVID-19 testingfree at the point of service, and many insurers havewaived cost sharingfor COVID-19 treatment. However, medical bills remain a top concern for many Americans, and this could worsen with the pandemic given the strain in financial security as many individuals contend withjob or income loss.",
            "8. In December 2020, U.S. federal officials warned states that patient care might suffer as hospitalizations continue surging and health care staffing capacity reaches its limits across the U.S. As health care resources are strained to meet surging COVID-19 pandemic demand, quality of care might suffer. Other comparable countries might also have worsened quality of care due to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, the U.S. had the highest rate ofmedical errors.",
            "9. The occurrence ofhospital-acquired conditions(e.g., surgical infections or medication errors) has improved, declining 13% from 2014 to 2017. It is not clear if the pandemic will impact the rate of hospital-acquired conditions. With strained hospital resources, hospital-acquired conditions could also deteriorate. Additionally, the pandemic poses a coronavirus infection risk for patients and staff in the hospital itself.",
            "10. The increase in delayed or forgone care during 2020 is likely to worsen treatable and preventable death rates in the U.S. and comparable countries. In 2017, the U.S. had the highestrate of treatable deaths(those that could have been avoided through timely and effective care) andpreventable deaths(those that could have be avoided through primary prevention) among peer countries. Compared to the average of comparable countries,potentially preventable hospital admissionsrates are higher in the U.S. for several diseases that could possibly be prevented or treated in a non-emergency setting, including for congestive heart failure (88% higher), asthma (8% higher), and diabetes (53% higher). Hypertension is an exception, as U.S. admission rates are 12% lower than the comparable country average.",
            "Health disparities in the U.S. are likely to worsen due to the pandemic. COVID-19 related hospitalizations andmortalityhave disproportionately impacted Black, Native American and Alaska Native, Hispanic, and low-income people in the U.S. Although the U.S. health system’s performance has generally improved over time across many indicators, manydisparitieshave persisted across racial or ethnic groups and by gender, age, health status, and income level. In 2017,life expectancyfor Black Americans was 3.7 years shorter than the average across all races in the U.S. Black Americans tend to have highercardiovascular diseasedeath rates than White Americans. Black women tend to experience higher rates ofcesarean sectionsfor low-risk births than other groups.",
            "Poorer outcomes are affected by interactions – or lack thereof – with the ­health system, along with other social determinants of health. Data on access to care further highlight disparities across racial and ethnic groups. Hispanic populations have almost twice higheruninsured ratesthan other populations in the U.S.  In 2019, 21% of Black non-elderly adults haddifficulty paying medical billscompared to 15% of all non-elderly adults, and 63% Hispanic individuals worried about their ability to pay medical bills compared to 51% of all non-elderly adults.",
            "The pandemic has abruptly shifted trends in health outcomes, spending, and access to healthcare. Although it will take years to analyze the pandemic’s effect on the U.S. health system, early data show an unprecedented downward effect on health spending in 2020 and further widening of the gap in health outcomes between the U.S. and its peers. COVID-19 will likely have both a direct and indirect effect on health outcomes and costs due to postponed or delayed care. The pandemic is highlighting the gaps in the U.S. health system, providing an opportunity to assess and redress the U.S. health system performance and resilience.",
            "Visit the Health System Dashboardto explore more data on these trends and additional indicators of health system performance.",
            "Where possible, we compare the U.S. to other similarly large and wealthy countries as measured by median GDP and median GDP per capita. These countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.",
            "Data were collected and analyzed by researchers at KFF using a variety of data sources (which can be found for specific indicators on the indicator page on the dashboard). The dashboard includes more than 50 indicators of health system performance, organized into four domains – a structure based largely on the framework put forth in the National Academy of Medicine’s 2015 Vital Signs: Core Metrics for Health and Health Care Progress. Indicators on the dashboard were selected through consultation with other experts in the field and a review of various additional sources of data on quality and outcomes measurement, including: National Quality Forum; Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS); Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS); America’s Health Rankings; Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA); CMS Hospital Compare; US News and World Report; America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP)/CMS Core Quality Measures Collaborative; Commonwealth Fund; as well as a review of sources for data on health spending, such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index is a metric developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.",
            "The dashboard is limited to some extent by what data are available at the health system level, particularly for indicators of health system quality (see our in-depth discussionhere). While health spending, access, and health status data are more readily available and standardized, some indicators of quality of care are less standardized and often only available nationally for the Medicare population. The quality measures included in the dashboard were selected through consultation with a number of experts in the field and present a comprehensive look at treatment outcomes, patient safety, appropriateness of treatments, use of preventive services, and health system resources.",

            "Earlier this year we released ananalysislooking at how often health plans had taken steps to limit out-of-pocket costs for their enrollees during the pandemic. We found that many individual and fully-insured group market insurers had waived cost-sharing (copays, coinsurance, or payments towards a deductible) for patients receiving treatment for COVID-19 at some point during the pandemic. These waivers covered a combined 88% of enrollees in both markets at some point during the pandemic. However, at the time of our last analysis, some waivers had already expired and many more were set to expire in the fall. At the time, we also found that a small number insurers across both markets had extended some form of premium relief to their enrollees, most often in the form of a premium credit or rebate.",
            "As the year has progressed, more data has become available to suggest that insurers have been quiteprofitableduring the pandemic. Overall healthcare utilization and spendingrapidly declinedthrough the first half of the year as consumers delayed elective or non-emergency care, leaving many insurers with far more premium income than claims costs. Under the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) rule, insurers must spend a certain amount of their premium income on health care costs for their enrollees or pay back any excess profits to consumers in the form of rebates the following year. As of June 2020, KFFanalysisfound that individual and fully-insured group market insurers were on track to owe substantial rebates to consumers based on their margins and medical loss ratios this year, and even though there are someindicationsthat healthcare utilization was returning to more normal levels, rising numbers of COVID-19 cases across the country may cause healthcare utilization and spending to decrease yet again this fall and winter.",
            "In this brief, we reevaluate the number of enrollees whose insurer has waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment at some point during the pandemic, as well as when these waivers are set to expire, to see how many insurers had extended the waivers beyond their earlier expiration dates, based on the trajectory of the pandemic and their financial performance. We also re-examine how many enrollees have been offered some form of premium credit or reduction thus far. We had previously speculated that insurers were issuing cost-sharing waivers and premium credits to increase their claims costs relative to their premium income in order to pre-empt massive MLR rebates they may owe next year. We find that, due to insurers delaying expiration dates, plans covering 71% of enrollees in all fully-insured commercial markets continue to have COVID-19 treatment cost waivers in place at this time. Additionally, plans covering 40% of enrollees in these markets have offered some form of premium relief.",
            "We reviewed an updated summary of private insurers’ responses to the pandemic compiled byAmerica’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). We systematically collected data from this summary and merged it onto enrollment data from Mark Farrah Associates TM in order to estimate how many individual and fully-insured group market enrollees are in plans that have waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment or are offering some form of premium relief.",
            "Importantly, our estimates do not include the substantial portion (61%) of the group market enrolled in self-insured employer plans. These plans are established and funded by an employer and are not always subject to federal regulation. As such, the benefit designs of these plans, including the services that they opt to cover and any associated cost-sharing, are left to the discretion of the employer. There is no source of comprehensive data on the prevalence of these policies and, therefore, they are not included in this analysis.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Federal legislation stillrequiresthat all private insurance plans, including self-funded plans, cover the entire cost associated with approved COVID-19testingso long as the test is deemed medically appropriate. However, there are still no provisions that require private insurers to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19treatment,such as hospitalizations. Only five states (MA, NM, ID, MI, MN) and D.C. require or have agreements in place with insurers to waive out-of-pocket treatment costs for their fully-insured plan enrollees, although, as this analysis finds, many insurers continue to voluntarily waive out-of-pocket costs for enrollees who require COVID-19-related treatment.",
            "Across all individual and fully-insured group plans, 88% of enrollees are in a plan that has at some point during the pandemic waived out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 treatment, the same share as when we initially checked in late July. Of these enrollees, 18% are in plans where that waiver has already expired, compared to 42% who would have been in plans where these waivers would have expired by now if insurers had not reevaluated their expiration dates since July. In other words, plans covering about 24% of enrollees across all fully-insured commercial markets extended their waiver expiration dates from some point in the past to the future. As a result, plans covering 71% of enrollees in all fully-insured commercial markets continue to have COVID-19 treatment cost waivers in place at this time.",
            "In total, 37 of the 61 insurers or parent companies we identified as having cost-sharing waivers have extended their expiration dates. Most notably, nearly half of enrollees (49%) in both markets are now in plans that have waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment until the end of the year, up from about a third (31%) during our initial review. Compared to late July, a similar share of enrollees are in plans that have not specified an end date on their waivers but several more insurers have waived cost-sharing until the end of the declared national public health emergency, currently set to expire on January 20, 2020 (Inauguration Day). Most of these waivers still only apply to COVID-19 treatment received from in-network providers or facilities and consumers who are treated out-of-network may be forced to pay the entire cost of their treatment.",
            "Included in these estimates are enrollees who live in one of the five states or the District of Columbia that mandate or have agreements with fully-funded insurers to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment, although the expiration dates of these mandates vary by state. Combined, these states account for 7% of the individual market and 9% of the fully-insured group market. Roughly 80% of enrollees in either market are in a plan that voluntarily waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment at some point during the pandemic.",
            "Insurers are generally not allowed to change the amount of premiums owed in the middle of a plan year; however, CMS releasedguidanceearlier in the year allowing individual and small-group insurers to temporarily offer premiums credits to enrollees. As of late July, 11% of individual market enrollees and 27% of fully-insured group market enrollees were in plans offering some form of premium relief (credit or reduction). The chart below shows how these shares have grown, as more insurers have moved to offer premium relief in the time since.",
            "Currently, 29% of individual market enrollees and 44% of fully-insured group market enrollees are in plans that have already or will soon offer premium credits. Premium credits are likely more common among fully-insured group plans because most individual market enrollees receive some form of financial assistance (i.e. Advanced Premium Tax Credits, Cost-Sharing Reductions).",
            "Motivated by high profits and some state requirements, many insurers have offered financial relief to their enrollees amid the coronavirus pandemic, primarily through waived COVID-19 treatment costs and less commonly through premium credits or reductions. Since we first reviewed the prevalence of these waivers and premium credits in July, many insurers have extended their waivers or newly moved to offered premium relief to their enrollees. Most cost-sharing waivers are set to expire at the end of the year or early in 2021, though it is possible that some insurers will extend these benefits once again, particularly if the national public health emergency declaration is extended next year.",
            "Consumers who seek treatment for COVID-19 (especially those who are treated by out-of-network providers) are likely to facehigh costsfor care, which might be even more burdensome without cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 treatment. Importantly, 61% of covered workers are in self-insured plans that are not explicitly covered by these waivers. Self-funded employers ultimately decide whether to waive cost-sharing or not, though some insurers allow self-funded employers to opt-in to such waivers. At this time, we do not have data on how many self-funded employers have waived these costs.",
            "Because of the substantial drop in overallhealthcare utilizationthis year, insurers are still on-track to see considerable profits by the end of this year. This continued profitability means that, even with many waivers extended through the end of the year and more insurers offering premium credits, insurers may still owe enrollees substantial MLR rebates next year.",
            "We reviewed asummaryof private insurers responses to the pandemic, put together by America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the trade association representing private insurers. We systematically collected data from this summary as of November 12, 2020. For plans included in the AHIP summary, we merged on enrollment data as of the first quarter of 2020. Enrollment data were reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and compiled by Mark Farrah Associated TM. State actions on cost-sharing and premium policies were sourced from KFF’s tracker ofState Data and Policy Actions to Address Coronavirus, which is updated daily.",

            "It is well documented that the U.S. is anoutlier among peer countrieswhen it comes to health spending, and recent Peterson-KFFanalysisfinds that the cost of inpatient and outpatient care is the primary driver behind this gap in health expenditures. In addition, countless news articles have highlighted extremely high medical bills sent to patients, often resulting from balance billing from out-of-network providers. However, the actual costs of specific healthcare services in the U.S. are often hard to track down and can vary widely between plans and across the country.",
            "In this analysis, we explore the average cost of several common healthcare services in the U.S. We analyzed data from a sample of the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which includes health claims from non-elderly people enrolled in large employer plans. When possible, we show how these costs have changed over time and how they vary geographically.",
            "The charts in this analysis show average allowed amounts large employer health plans agree to pay for in-network and out-of-network care. We refer to “cost” as the weighted average total expenditures made towards a given admission or service, including the portion paid by the health plan and any out-of-pocket costs paid by enrollees under the plan’s cost sharing. However, the charts do not include anybalance bills(“surprise bills”) that out-of-network providers may send directly to patients.",
            "This collection demonstrates that the costs associated with many common health services have risen more rapidly than general economic inflation, and that there are large geographic variations in the cost of the same health services across the United States. For example:",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "The average cost of an inpatient hospital admission for people with large employer coverage was $24,680 in 2018. The cost of a hospitalization varies widely, depending on the reason for the admission. Maternity and newborn admissions, for example, average $14,952, while the cost of a surgical admission is much higher, averaging $47,345. For the purposes of this analysis, the cost of an inpatient admission includes the cost of professional services provided by physicians or hospital staff as well as any drugs that may have been administered during the hospital stay.",
            "Among people with large employer coverage, the average cost of inpatient hospital admissions has increased by nearly $10,000 (68%) since 2008. Inpatient admissions for surgical care experienced the steepest cost increases, rising by $22,291 (89%) over the decade. General medical admission costs also rose steeply, by $9,850, or 85%, over the decade. Psychiatric and substance use admissions also increased in cost by $6,139 (82%). For reference, inflation increased 17% over the same period.",
            "The cost of an inpatient admission has increased across all regions since 2008. The chart above shows the average cost of an inpatient admission across the 25 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with the highest number of inpatient admissions among large employer plans in 2018.",
            "On average, inpatient hospital admissions were most expensive in the San Diego, CA, area in both 2008 and 2018. The least expensive areas for an inpatient stay also remained constant over that period – St. Louis, MO and the Louisville area in KY and IN.",
            "This figure shows the average cost of an inpatient admission for a full knee or hip replacement in most populous MSAs with more than 125 procedures in 2018. There is considerable geographic variation in the average cost paid by large employer plans and their enrollees for these surgeries. For instance, the average cost of a full knee or hip replacement in the New York City area is $56,739, which is 127% higher than the average cost in the Baltimore area ($25,044) and 61% higher than the national average ($35,263).",
            "The average cost of an inpatient admission for a full knee or hip replacement increased 38% (or $9,662) from 2008 to 2018, compared to a 17% increase in inflation over the same period (as measured by the GDP deflator).",
            "Among large employer plans, the average cost of an inpatient admission for a laparoscopic appendectomy was $23,385 in 2018. The average cost for a laparoscopic appendectomy nearly doubled from 2008 to 2018 (increase of $11,456 or 96%), growing much faster than inflation over the same period (17%).",
            "A laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the surgical removal of the gallbladder. The cost of an inpatient admission for this surgery nearly doubled from $15,900 in 2008 to $28,233 in 2018 – an increase of 78% over ten years, which was more than four times faster than inflation (17%).",

            "Health Spending",
            "There is considerable geographic variation in the average cost paid among large employer plans for an inpatient hospitalization that includes a heart attack. For instance, the average cost of a hospital stay that includes a heart attack in the New York area is $65,138, which is 37% higher than the national average ($47,666) and 137% higher than the average cost in the Baltimore area ($27,434).",
            "The Baltimore area has lower-than-average costs for many inpatient admissions, including the lowest average cost for knee or hip replacements and inpatient admissions related to a heart attack. These lower inpatient prices may be due in part toMaryland’s all payer rate setting program.",
            "Coronary artery disease— the buildup of plaque leading to reduced blood flow to the heart— forms the pathogenic basis for heart disease and heart attacks, theleading cause of deathin the United States and amajor driverof health spending.",
            "Common treatments for these conditions aim to circumvent blockages in the arteries, and include cardiac catheterization and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (bypass surgery). Cardiac catheterization involves injecting a dye into the blood vessel to diagnose a blockage, and placement of a stent if appropriate. Bypass surgery involves grafting one or more blood vessels from other parts of the body with the coronary arteries to restore blood flow to the heart.",
            "The average cost of an inpatient admission that included bypass surgery with catheterization (with or without a stent) and major complications was nearly $117,000 in 2018. An admission for a bypass surgery that did not involve catheterization or complications was $75,688 on average.",
            "Hysterectomy costs vary based on the surgical method used and how much of the uterus and surrounding organs are removed. Most inpatient hysterectomies performed are ‘abdominal’ meaning the surgeon removes the uterus through a larger incision over the belly. This is in contrast to ‘laparoscopic’ and ‘vaginal’ approaches, which refer to performing the operation through smaller incisions in the abdomen or through the vagina, respectively.",
            "Most inpatient hysterectomies are consideredtotalhysterectomies, in which the surgeon removes the whole uterus and cervix. Other kinds includesubtotalhysterectomies (removal of only a portion of the uterus leaving the cervix intact) andradicalhysterectomies (removal of the whole uterus, the cervix, and the top part of the vagina). Any of these types of hysterectomies could also include the surgical removal of one or both of the fallopian tubes and/or ovaries.",
            "Among large employer plans, the average cost of an inpatient admission for a total abdominal hysterectomy was $20,937 in 2018. Inpatient admissions for abdominal radical hysterectomies were substantially more costly at $36,485 on average, possibly because they are more invasive and because radical hysterectomies are often associated with malignancy and more complex conditions. The following chart shows costs for laparoscopic hysterectomies.",
            "Laparoscopic hysterectomies are more common in outpatient settings and the cost of these procedures varies less dramatically than inpatient abdominal hysterectomies. On an outpatient basis, the average cost of a subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy ($16,790) is just $343 less than the average cost of a total laparoscopic hysterectomy ($17,133). Laparoscopic hysterectomies are less invasive and, in most cases, require less recovery time than abdominal hysterectomies. Radical hysterectomies are also less commonly performed in outpatient settings.",
            "Outpatient physician visits with the highest level of acuity (the most severe and most complex) are coded as Level 5, whereas visits for straightforward, minor conditions are coded as Level 1.  Physician visits for the most complex cases (Level 5) cost an average of $182 per visit, while compared to $46 for the simplest visits. The most common physician visits are coded as Level 3, which average $90 per visit. Overall, the average cost of an outpatient visit was $105 in 2018.",
            "The following chart shows how the cost of an office visit has changed over time for each level.",
            "Average costs have increased for each of the five levels of office visits. From 2008 to 2018, the average cost of Level 1 office visits increased by $15 (or 52%) and the average cost of Level 5 office visits increased by $49 (or 37%). The average cost of Level 3 office visits, by far the most commonly coded severity, rose by $20 (or 29%) over the same period.",
            "This chart shows the variation in the cost of Level 3 outpatient office visits across the largest MSAs with more than 10,000 visits in 2018. As an example, the average office visit in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area ($144) is more than double the average cost in the Louisville area ($68) and 60% higher than the national average ($90).",
            "Not all services have experienced rapid increases in prices. In 2018, the average price of an outpatient lower back MRI was $861, up from $784 in 2008. This represents a 9% price increase over 10 years, which was lower than general price inflation over the same period (17%). The prices here include the cost of the MRI itself and the professional cost of the radiologist interpretation.",
            "While the average price of a lower back MRI did not substantial increase from 2008 to 2018, there is large variation in the price of this procedure across the country. The highest average price for a lower back MRI is in the Houston, TX area ($1,106), which is nearly triple the average price in the Las Vegas area ($404), and 32% higher than the national average ($861).",
            "Meniscus repair is an outpatient surgical procedure to repair torn knee cartilage. The national average cost for this procedure is $7,595, but there is considerable variation across MSAs. For example, the highest average cost for outpatient meniscus repair surgery is in the NYC area ($11,219), more than double the cost in the Detroit area ($4,655), and 48% higher than the national average.",
            "The national average cost of an allergy test is $424, but there is a considerable range in prices across geographic areas. The highest average price for an allergy test is in the Cambridge, MA area ($575), which is 76% higher more than the average price in the Detroit area ($326).",
            "Although recent policies have attempted to improve the transparency of health prices, a general lack of transparency makes it difficult for enrollees to know the total cost of a procedure or visit in advance, and even more difficult for them to know what their own liability may be. Additionally, many patients inadvertently receive treatment from out-of-network providers, putting them at risk forsurprise medical bills. While this analysis examines average costs paid by insurers and enrollees for a number of common services, it also highlights the significant costs people may face for out-of-network providers.",
            "The high cost of inpatient and outpatient care is theprimary driverof the difference in health spending between the U.S. and similarly large and wealthy countries. As this analysis shows, even within the U.S., the cost of common health services can vary considerably from city to city (and a related analysis shows how these costs can even vary widely within cities). In some cases, this variation may be due to differences in severity of illness or complexity of service, but in other cases, this variation highlights extremely high and questionable prices set for care.",
            "This analysis also shows that the cost of several health services has increased at a rate faster than general economic inflation – in some cases, many times faster. These rapidly rising costs of health services underlie growing premiums and deductibles for people with employer health insurance. Over the last decade, the amount employees have paid toward their premiums and out-of-pocket costs hasexceeded wages, meaning that health care costs – and other expenses – have become harder to afford, even for those with relatively generous health coverage.",
            "We analyzed a sample of claims obtained from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database (MarketScan). The database has claims provided by large employers (those with more than 1,000 employees). This analysis only includes costs for services covered by large employer plans. We used a subset of claims from the years 2008 through 2018. In 2018, there were claims for almost 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market.",

            "Access & Affordability",
            "Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for large group enrollees by sex, age, state and whether the enrollee was a policy holder or dependent. People 65 and over were excluded. We also limited claims to fee-for-service claims (excluding claims collected on an encounter basis). For all inpatient admissions, we excluded the top 0.5% of claims and claims that fall below either $5,000 or 10% of the average total price off the service, whichever is lower. For outpatient services or procedures, we also exclude the top 0.5% of claims and, unless otherwise specified below, claims that fall below either $5 or 10% of the average total price of the service, whichever is lower.",
            "When showing the cost of a common service over time, we use the GDP deflator to benchmark the change in the price of the specific service against the change of prices in the general economy. The GDP deflator is a measure of inflation that captures the prices of all new, domestically produced goods and services. For charts depicting variation in the cost of a common service across Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), we select the 25 most populous MSAs with more than 125 procedures (unless otherwise specified in the text).",
            "Midway through 2015, MarketScan claims transitioned from ICD-9 to ICD-10. While both systems classify procedures, they do not precisely crosswalk. Below is a summary of which codes we included:",

            "COVID-19 deaths in the United States have surpassed 200,000, and the coronavirus is now the third leading cause of death in this country, after heart disease and cancer. Before the pandemic, the U.S. already had the highest overall mortality rate among similarly large and wealthy countries, and the gap has widened in the last few decades.",
            "In this analysis, we put the pandemic’s toll into perspective by comparing where COVID-19 falls as a leading cause of death in the U.S. versus peer countries (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member nations with above median GDP and above median GDP per capita). We find that COVID-19 mortality rates are the third leading cause of death in the U.S., and COVID-19 ranks as the third highest in only one peer country, Belgium. In several peer countries (Australia, Austria, Germany, and Japan), COVID-19 is not close to breaking into the top 10 leading causes of death. Further, the U.S. nears the top of the list of countries most affected by COVID-19 on a per capita basis, surpassed only by Belgium and the United Kingdom. Finally, on a per capita basis, excess deaths this year are highest in the U.S. and the U.K. Taken together these findings suggest the pandemic will likely increase the existing mortality rate gap between the U.S. and its peers.",
            "To assess where COVID-19 falls as a leading cause of death in similarly large and wealthy countries, we compared the number of deaths for the top 5 leading causes in 2017 (or the nearest data year with available data) to the number of deaths caused by COVID-19 in 2020 through October 15, 2020. Heading into the final two months of the year, we find that COVID-19 already ranks as the third leading cause of death in two of the twelve peer countries: Belgium and the U.S. In both countries, COVID-19 deaths are surpassed only by deaths due to cancer and heart disease. Although much could change in the next couple of months, in Belgium and the U.S., COVID-19 is unlikely to surpass the second leading cause of death. The ultimate ranking of COVID-19 as a leading cause of death may change in the rest of the peer countries, given that there are over two months remaining in the year.",
            "Importantly, the pandemic may have affected mortality rates for other leading causes in 2020, which are not accounted for in these rankings. For example, deaths caused by car accidents may be lower in 2020 in places with periods of lockdown or strictly enforced social distancing. On the other hand, the pandemic could have potentially increased deaths from other causes, for example, from people delaying or not seeking care they otherwise would have.",
            "In three other peer countries—France, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—COVID-19 currently ranks as the fourth leading cause of death. In Sweden, COVID-19 is very close to becoming the third leading cause of death.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "In Canada, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, COVID-19 has reached the top 10 leading causes of death. Meanwhile, in Australia, Austria, Germany and Japan, COVID-19 ranks 21st, 18th, 17thand 29th, respectively, out of 32 disease categories.",
            "With 66.5 COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people, the U.S. ranks second (after Belgium) on a per capita basis among comparable countries, as of October 15, 2020. Ranking by per capita COVID-19 deaths, the U.S. is firmly behind Belgium (90.4 deaths per 100,000 people) and followed closely by the U.K. and Sweden (65.3 and 58.0 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively).",
            "By contrast, Canada has less than half as many COVID-19 deaths per capita (26.3 deaths per 100,000 people) compared to the U.S. Austria, Australia, and Japan rank as the bottom three among peer countries, with 9.9, 3.6, and 1.3 COVID-19 related deaths per 100,000 people, respectively. This shows a rather large gap between the peer countries more severely affected by the pandemic and those with lower COVID-19 mortality rates.",
            "As seen in the overall deaths per capita, the U.S. had the highest overall death rate prior to COVID-19. The U.S. death rate per 100,000 from all causes was 840.2, compared to an average of 693.4 for peer countries in 2017. Prior to COVID-19, the U.S. had an additional 60 overall deaths per 100,000 people over the next closest country, Germany. Germany has one sixth of the number of per capita COVID-19 deaths as the U.S. so far in 2020.  COVID-19 will therefore likely increase this mortality gap between the U.S. and peer countries.",
            "During major public health crises, it can prove difficult to track down the exact number of deaths caused by the crisis directly. With limited capabilities, especially early in a pandemic, epidemiologists turn to excess deaths to put in context official death counts. Excess deaths represent the number of deaths exceeding what is expected in a typical year. This measurement serves as a good proxy for the potential mortality directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "The CDC data shows the excess deaths in the U.S. exceeds average expected number of deaths based on the prior years. Specifically, there were 289,405 excess deaths from the beginning of the year through October 10, 2020, shown by the blue area in the chart above. CDC recently published abriefon October 20, 2020, stating the high-end estimate of excess deaths totaled nearly 300,000 individuals, as of October 3, 2020. CDC also noted the deaths count attributed to COVID-19 represents two-thirds of the excess deaths count through October 3, 2020. This suggests the true toll of the pandemic might be undercounted by a large margin both due to the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19. CDC has stated that the death count from causes that could be related to COVID-19 infections have also increased in 2020 (circulatory diseases, Alzheimer disease and dementia, and respiratory diseases). So, the difference between the excess deaths and the deaths attributed to COVID-19 might be because of an undercount of COVID-19 deaths, and the indirect impact of the pandemic leading to additional fatalities, including due to delayed or foregone care.",
            "The U.S.’s excess deaths count per 100,00 people is also higher than that for comparable countries. The U.S. has the second highest excess deaths count per 100,000 people at 85.2, with the U.K having the highest at 87.4 excess deaths per 100,000 people as of August 16, 2020. However, using more recent data from August 30, 2020, the U.S. has a higher rate of excess deaths per 100,000 at 90.1 than the U.K., which has 89.6 per capita. This data was not used in the chart above because not all countries reported data as of this week. As mentioned above, the U.S. already had the highest deaths per capita over peer countries, and the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate this mortality gap.",
            "The above graph shows that in recent decades the mortality rate has steadily decreased in the U.S. and in comparable countries. The U.S., however, has diverged from the comparable country averages and has had a higher mortality rate than all its peer countries even before the pandemic. While the exact degree is uncertain, it is evident that the outsized impact of the pandemic on the U.S. will likely widen the disparity in mortality and other health outcomes between the U.S. and other comparable countries.",
            "With over two months left in the year, the COVID-19 death count will continue to rise. This has the potential to change where COVID-19 places among leading causes of death across countries, as well as where the U.S. ranks among its peers on per capita deaths due to COVID-19. In this analysis of the pandemic’s effect on the U.S. and peer countries, we find that COVID-19 is already in the top three leading causes of death in the U.S. and Belgium; in Sweden, it is close to being in the top three as well. While COVID-19 is among the top ten leading causes of death in many peer countries, few have been affected as severely as the U.S. With higher numbers of excess deaths per capita, the outsized effect of the pandemic on the U.S. will likely widen the existing gap in mortality rates between the U.S. and peer countries.",
            "We used theOECDHealth Statistics “Causes of mortality” data from 2017 for top 5 causes of deaths. For countries where 2017 data were not unavailable, we used data from 2016. Disease grouping was done such that it was similar to the CDC’s “Deaths and Mortality” causes of death groupings. Heart disease includes all diseases of the circulatory system minus strokes, which is a separate grouping; cancer includes malignant neoplasms; and chronic respiratory includes asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. COVID-19 death counts are derived from the Our World in Data (referred to as “OWID”) for to estimate the rank compared to other causes of death.",
            "The COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 people data are from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus ResourceCenterfor the U.S. and peer countries. We used OECD Health Statistics for the overall deaths per 100,000 for 2017, or 2016 for countries where 2017 data was not available.",
            "For the analysis showing observed deaths over those expected in 2020, we usedCDC’s excess deaths data through October 10, 2020, which became available on October 21, 2020. For the comparison of excess deaths per 100,000 across countries, we used the OWID Human Mortality Database as of August 16, 2020, which is the week that all countries had data available. For each country, we divided total excess deaths by the 2018 OECD population count in order to get our excess deaths per 100,000 estimate.",
            "When comparing between countries, we used the data as of the latest week or date available. However, we acknowledge that peer countries have differing public health infrastructures, testing capabilities, and methodology in determining what constitutes a COVID-19 related death, and that the findings in this brief are at least partially due to those differences. For example, Belgium cast a wide net in its definition of COVID-19 related deaths. Officials inBelgiumhave included all  deaths in hospitals and care homes that are suspected but not confirmed to have been caused by COVID-19, and, as a result, it is likely that comparatively more deaths in Belgium were categorized as COVID-19 deaths than in other peer countries. In the U.S., theCDCissued guidance to use information from COVID-19 tests where possible and to report all cases where it is “probable” or “presumed” that the death was caused by COVID-19 whenever testing is not available. However, the actual approach U.S. states and counties have taken to reporting has varied significantly; moststateshave opted to only attribute confirmed COVID-19 deaths as such.",

            "Public health efforts aim to promote population health and wellbeing and generally include avariety of initiatives, such as disaster preparedness, nutrition and education programs, disease prevention programs, and epidemiological surveillance. The COVID-19 pandemic is testing governments’ capacities to address a public health crisis, with some countries struggling more than others to respond. In the U.S., there are concerns regarding the public health system’s capacity to respond to the current pandemic and future public health crises.",
            "The following charts explore high-level trends in public health and related spending over time in the U.S. and other similarly wealthy countries (OECD nations with above average GDP and GDP per capita), as well as spending for public health at the federal vs. state and local levels in the U.S.",
            "While it is difficult to compare how each country funds specific public health interventions, OECD data provide comparisons of national spending on “preventive care,” which generally includes spending on programs for public health information, education, and counseling; immunization, early disease detection, healthy condition monitoring programs (e.g., for monitoring pregnancy, child growth and development, general health check-ups); epidemiological surveillance; and emergency preparedness and disaster response. As these efforts largely reflect public health initiatives rather than personal healthcare services, comparing preventive care spending offers a rough comparison. It should be noted that “preventive care” spending as documented by the OECD is more inclusive than the definition of “public health” spending in CMS National Health Expenditure Accounts data for the U.S. For example, for the U.S., OECD estimates of preventive care spending include some spending on maternal and child health and school health programs, which are not reported as public health activities in the U.S. National Health Expenditure Accounts.",
            "Preventive care spending in the U.S. constituted 2.9% of total health expenditures in 2018 – slightly higher than similarly large and wealthy countries on average (2.4%).",
            "Over time, spending on preventive care in the U.S. has declined as a percent of total national health spending, from 3.7% in 2000 to 2.9% in 2018. Meanwhile, in similarly wealthy countries, spending on preventive care as a portion of total health spending has remained about flat on average.",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Quality of Care",
            "In the U.S., state and local governments account for the majority of national spending on public health activities. In 2018, state and localities spent $81.5 billion on public health, while federal public health spending was $12.0 billion.",
            "Federal stimulus funding may help to alleviate some of the current pandemic’s burden on the public health infrastructure. TheCoronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Actallocated nearly $6.2 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services, including $1.9 billion towards Centers for Disease Control (CDC) response efforts. Appropriations under theCARES Actincluded $4.3 billion for CDC coronavirus-related activities and $275 million for the Health Resources and Services Administration’s related activities. Additionally, some states have committed funding towards their pandemic response.",
            "Preventable deaths are those that could have been thwarted by public health interventions like vaccination programs or widespread screening for diseases like tuberculosis and diabetes. The U.S. has long had a higher rate of preventable deaths than all comparable countries. The rate of these deaths had been dropping overall in the U.S. through 2012, after which the rate of preventable deaths began to increase in the U.S. but continued to fall in comparable countries. This increase in U.S. preventable deaths parallels deaths due to the U.S. opioid epidemic, which has been characterized by waves of increases indrug overdose deaths, including a wave of overdose deaths due to heroin beginning in 2010 and another wave due to synthetic opioids beginning in 2013.",

            "Compared to other private health plans in the U.S., coverage offered by large employers tends to be the most generous and comprehensive. However, even in these relatively generous plans, out-of-pocket spending has risen abouttwice as fastas workers’ wages in the last decade. Deductibles have risen and become more common, driving this rapid growth in out-of-pocket spending.",
            "Rising deductibles have in turn raised concerns about affordability.Four in tenadults with employer coverage reported having problems affording their medical bills in a recentsurvey. The burden of increasing cost-sharing may be shifting employees’ priorities, as health costs have overtaken provider choice as the primary reason workers choose their health plan.",
            "This analysis looks at trends in out-of-pocket costs and the demographics and health conditions of people who face these high costs. In particular, we look at people with large employer coverage who had high annual out-of-pocket spending of over $2,000 in one year. The typical deductible for a typical employer plan exceeds $1,500. We analyzed a sample of health benefit claims from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. The sample was limited to people under the age of 65 who were enrolled in their plan for more than half a year. Out-of-pocket spending in this analysis reflects cost-sharing (coinsurance, co-payments, deductibles) for covered services. Importantly, this does not include balance bills (also known as surprise bills) for non-covered services. Please see our relatedanalysisfor more information on surprise bills.",
            "We find that 12% of people with large employer coverage had more than $2,000 in out-of-pocket spending in 2018. High out-of-pocket spending becomes more likely as people age and is more likely for women than for men, as well as for people with certain health conditions including cancers, mental health disorders, and diabetes.",

            "People with large employer health coverage spent an average of $802 out-of-pocket, with deductibles accounting for over half of that spending ($417) in 2018. The vast majority (82%) of people with coverage from a large employer had some amount of out-of-pocket health spending. Roughly one in 10 enrollees (12%) faced more than $2,000 in out-of-pocket spending that year (referred to as “high” out-of-pocket spending in the remainder of this analysis).",
            "Asdeductibleshave increased and become more common, more enrollees have reached higher thresholds of out-of-pocket spending. Over the last fifteen years (from 2003 to 2018), the share of people with large employer coverage with over $2,000 in annual out-of-pocket spending (in constant 2018 dollars) increased from 4% to 12% of enrollees.",
            "Out-of-pocket spending on outpatient services constitutes the bulk of cost-sharing for both those with high out-of-pocket spending and all enrollees on average. Enrollees with high out-of-pocket spending average $2,673 in outpatient out-of-pocket spending (73% of their average, high out-of-pocket spending), while the average enrollee has $604 in outpatient out-of-pocket spending (75% of average out-of-pocket spending). Even so, those with high out-of-pocket spending see a greater share of their out-of-pocket costs go towards inpatient spending ($467 on average, or 13% of their average, high out-of-pocket spending) than do enrollees on average ($64 on average, or 8% of average out-of-pocket spending).",
            "Among nonelderly people (including adults and covered children) with health coverage from a large employer, female enrollees are more likely than male enrollees to have over $2,000 in out-of-pocket spending (15% of female enrollees compared to 10% of male enrollees in 2018). Among all enrollees, female enrollees averaged 35% more in out-of-pocket spending than male enrollees ($919 vs $680 in 2018).",

            "People are more likely to have high out-of-pocket spending as they age. Among nonelderly people with large employer coverage, 6% of children (enrollees up to age 17) and 11% of adults ages 18 to 34 had out-of-pocket spending over $2,000 in 2018. This high level of out-of-pocket spending was more common among older enrollees: 13% of enrollees ages 35-44, 16% of those ages 45-54, and 20% of those ages 55-64 had out-of-pocket spending over $2,000 in 2018.",
            "Although 12% of enrollees in large employer plans have out-of-pocket costs exceeding $2,000, those with certain cancer diagnoses are much more likely to have high costs. In 2018, 65% of enrollees with certain gastrointestinal cancers had high (>$2,000) out-of-pocket spending. One in every two people with colorectal, lymphatic, urinary, or ovarian cancer had out-of-pocket spending in excess of $2,000. Not all of this out-of-pocket spending is for cancer treatment specifically, as many people have other diagnoses (comorbidities) that also contribute to their out-of-pocket liability.",
            "A quarter of large employer plan enrollees who had mental health diagnoses in 2018 had out-of-pocket spending in excess of $2,000. Notably, out-of-pocket spending exceeded $2,000 for 58% of instances of suicide or intentional, self-inflicted injury.",
            "Average out-of-pocket spending for all enrollees with a mental health related diagnosis ranged from $1,228 for enrollees with attention deficit conduct and disruptive behavior disorders to $2,996 on average for instances of suicide or intentional self-harm.",
            "Among enrollees in large employer plans, high out-of-pocket spending is more common for those who have diabetes complications (40% of diagnosed enrollees in 2018 had out-of-pocket costs in excess of $2,000, compared to 12% of all enrollees). Even diabetes patients without complications are substantially more at risk of high out-of-pocket costs (30% of diagnosed enrollees had out-of-pocket costs in excess of $2,000 in 2018).",
            "Average out-of-pocket spending for all enrollees with an endocrine system disease ranged from $1,373 for enrollees with lipid metabolism disorders to $2,570 for enrollees with immunity disorders.",

We only included claims for people under the age of 65, as people over the age of 65 are typically on covered by Medicare. This analysis used claims for almost 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market in 2018. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of 1,000 or more workers by sex, age and state. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",

A limitation of these data is that they reflect cost sharing incurred under the benefit plan and do not include balance-billing payments that beneficiaries may make directly to health care providers.",

            "Over the last couple of years, there has been increased attention on the price of prescription drugs;polling datahas shown that almost eight in ten people in the U.S. say the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable, and three in ten report they have not taken a prescription medicine as directed because of the cost.",
            "This chart collection explores trends in spending on prescription drugs among people with employer coverage, with a particular focus on people with high drug spending. Havingpreviously explorednational trends in prescription drug spending using data from the National Health Expenditures Account, in this analysis, we look at trends specifically for nonelderly people with large employer coverage (including employees and their covered spouses and dependents), using a large sample of claims data. Doing so allows us to understand more about the demographics of people who have high drug spending, and whether they are more likely to have certain health conditions.",
            "We use a sample of the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database that includes claims provided by employers with more than 1,000 employees. This analysis focuses on spending for drugs purchased from a pharmacy, also called retail drugs. While people also face costs for drugs administered at a physician’s office or hospital (non-retail drugs), these costs are not as easily identified in claims data. One important limitation of this analysis is that the claims data do not include information about the value of rebates to insurers or patient assistant programs administered separately from the plan. We note when rebates are accounted for in these graphs, and when their absence is particularly limiting.",
            "We find that about 4% of people with employer coverage have prescription drug costs totaling $5,000 or more, and about 3% have out-of-pocket prescription drug costs exceeding $1,000. Enrollees with total prescription drug spending exceeding $5,000 are more likely to be older and have health conditions such as infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory conditions, mental illness, cancers and tumors, digestive diseases, endocrine disorders, and circulatory diseases.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "In 2018, prescription drug spending grew by 1.9% nationally (based on data from the National Health Expenditures Accounts) and by 3.3% for large employer plans.",
            "In the 2010s, there was relatively low growth in drug costs in large employer plans, but, much like national spending, employer plans saw a large spike in drug spending of 14.6% in 2014 following the introduction of highly-priced specialty drugs and price increases for some brand name drugs. Spending growth moderated over the following two years, with almost no growth in 2016, followed by 5.3% growth in 2017 and 3.3% growth in 2018.",
            "Looking at overall national health spending, drugs accounted for just 9% of total health spending in 2018. (The NHE data does adjust for rebates). Meanwhile, in the employer market, where enrollees tend to be healthier on average, drugs represent a larger share of total spending.",
            "Retail prescription drug spending accounted for 21% of total spending in employer-sponsored health plans in 2018, before accounting forrebatesdrug manufacturers give to insurers and pharmacy benefits managers. Because drug spending represents a larger share of employer plans than for public programs, changes in drug prices or utilization can have a big effect on premiums and patient costs.",
            "Adjusting for an estimate of rebates lowers the share of spending in employer plans for drugs to 18%. We calculated the aggregate impact of rebates by applying the same proportion reported manufacturer rebates are of total prescription drug point-of-purchase spending by private insurance, usinga method similar to that described by Altarum. As we are only able to do this calculation in the aggregate, and not for specific drugs, the rest of this analysis shows spending before accounting for rebates.",
            "Each year, a relatively small share of people with large employer coverage have very high total retail drug spending. In 2018, 14% of enrollees had $1,000 or more in total retail drug spending, and a smaller share of enrollees saw even higher levels of drug spending: 9% of enrollees had $2,000 or more in drug spending, 4% had $5,000 or more, and just 2% had $10,000 or more in drug spending. This spending reflects the cost borne both by the health plan and by enrollees through cost-sharing, such as deductibles or copays.",
            "People with employer coverage whose drug spending exceed $5,000 are about 47 years old on average, while employees or their family members with drug costs below $100 are about 30 years old on average.",
            "Male enrollees are more likely than female enrollees to have very low drug spending (from $0 to $100), in large part due to many women taking oral contraceptives. However, male and female enrollees are similarly likely to have high drug spending.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Workers and their family members with certain health conditions tend to have higher total drug spending (the amount paid by insurance and out of pocket combined). For example, large employer plan enrollees diagnosed with diseases of the blood (such as hemophilia), cancers and tumors, digestive diseases, circulatory conditions, and endocrine disorders (such as diabetes and obesity) on average have total drug spending that is more than twice as high as the average across all enrollees.",
            "In addition to having high pharmacy (retail drug) spending, people with some health conditions also have high costs for drugs administered at a physician’s office or hospital (non-retail drugs). For example, many types of chemotherapy are administered in a physician’s office and would therefore not be counted as a retail drug. This chart also shows the costs of non-retail drugs administered in an outpatient setting (such as in doctors’ offices and clinics). Most drugs administered in an inpatient setting (such as in a hospital) are not itemized in a way that would allow us to show those costs.",
            "Workers and their family members with certain diagnoses are more likely to have exceptionally high retail drug spending. Just 4.4% percent of all enrollees in large employer plans have retail (pharmacy) drug spending that exceeds $5,000 in a given year. However, people diagnosed with conditions including infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory conditions, mental illness, cancers and tumors, digestive diseases, endocrine disorders, circulatory diseases, and diseases of the blood are all more likely to have retail drug spending in excess of $5,000.",
            "Out-of-pocket spending on retail prescription drugs declined from a recent high of $165 per person in 2009 to $134 in 2018, on average among people with employer coverage. When adjusted for inflation, average out-of-pocket retail drug spending for people with large employer coverage declined 29% from $190 per person in 2004 (in 2018 dollars) to $134 in 2018.",
            "Driving this drop in out-of-pocket spending on drugs was both a “patent cliff,” when several drugs faced generic substitution, and the Affordable Care Act’s requirement that oral contraceptives (and other preventive services) be covered without cost-sharing. Additionally, even as new high-priced specialty drugs entered the market, employer plans picked up a larger share of the costs.",
            "As drug costs have risen overall, large employer health plans have taken on a greater share of the costs, with drug coverage becoming more generous over time. Some of this increased generosity is potentially offset by increased rebates paid to insurers by manufacturers, which are not reflected in the amounts shown here. In 2018, large employer health plans covered about 89% of retail prescription drug spending on average, up from 80% in 2004.",
            "In 2004, people with large employer coverage had drug spending averaging $707, of which insurance covered $565 and enrollees paid the remaining $142 out-of-pocket. By 2018, average drug spending had increased to $1,258 per person, while out-of-pocket spending decreased to $134 on average, leaving insurers paying substantially more for retail drugs.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "Over time, out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs has shifted from being paid almost entirely through copayments towards greater deductible and coinsurance spending (reflecting a general trend of higher deductibles in employer plans). Enrollees may be more sensitive to the actual price of prescription drugs and other healthcare when they must pay deductibles and coinsurance than they are with copays, which are flat dollar amounts. Additionally, copays require smaller, periodic payments that may add up over time, while a deductible may need to be met at once, potentially causing affordability challenges.",
            "Most people with large employer coverage have little or no drug spending, and thus little or no out-of-pocket spending. However, some people have very high out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs. In 2018, 2.6% of people with large employer coverage had out-of-pocket drug exceeding $1,000 per year, and just under 1% had out-of-pocket spending over $2,000. Note that these data include out-of-pocket spending for covered services (cost sharing), but some enrollees may purchase drugs that are not covered and pay all of that cost without submitting a claim.",
            "In large employer health plans, people who have certain diagnoses are more likely to have high out-of-pocket retail drug spending (in excess of $1,000 per year). This is particularly the case for people with a blood disease or endocrine disorder diagnosis (6.9% and 7.3% have out-of-pocket drug costs in excess of $1,000, respectively, compared to 2.6% of all enrollees).",
            "People with more than $1,000 in out-of-pocket drug spending represent just 3% of all people with large employer coverage, yet their prescription drug claims account for 38% of total retail drug spending and 40% of all out-of-pocket drug spending across enrollees.",
            "For the analysis of large employer plans, we analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2018 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65, as people over the age of 65 are typically covered by Medicare. This analysis used claims for almost 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market in 2018. Seventy-percent of larger group enrollees who were enrolled for more than six months had at least one prescription drug claim in the year. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of 1,000 or more workers by sex, age, and state. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",
            "The advantage of using claims information to look at out-of-pocket spending is that we can look beyond plan provisions and focus on actual payment liabilities incurred by enrollees. A limitation of these data is that they reflect cost-sharing incurred under the benefit plan and do not include out-of-pocket payments for non-covered services. One important limitation of this analysis is that the claims data show the retail cost for prescription drugs and does not include information about the value of rebates that may be received by payers. Prescription drug rebates vary considerably across particular drugs and drug categories, which can affect the costs associated with the diagnoses those drugs are used to treat.",
            "ICD-10 diagnosis codes were used to classify 136 distinct illnesses and conditions.

            "NOTE: An updated version of this analysis ishere.",
            "While federal protectionspreventmost people from paying out-of-pocket for COVID-19testing, patients may face substantial costs if hospitalized fortreatmentbecause there are no provisions that require private insurance plans to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment. A previous KFFanalysisestimated that average out-of-pocket costs associated with an inpatient admission for COVID-19 treatment for patients with large employer coverage could exceed $1,300, though the amounts could be much higher for patients who are severely ill or use out-of-network services. People insured through the individual and small group markets also may face even higher levels of cost-sharing because these plans tend to have higher deductibles than employer-based plans.",
            "Many private insurers have taken steps in recent months to mitigate out-of-pocket costs during the pandemic. For example, anearlier KFF brieflooked at how many people were impacted by insurers waiving cost-sharing for telemedicine. Insurers have experienced lower-than-expected claimscostsduring the pandemic, as enrollees have delayed or forgone elective and less-urgent care. This has left insurers relatively profitable, which means they may owe very large rebates to consumers next year, under the Affordable Care Act’s Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) rule. By offering cost-sharing waivers insurers can essentially increase their claims costs relative to their premiums and make it more likely that they meet the MLR threshold. However, given their current financial trajectory and recent years of high profits, insurers may still owe large rebates next year even if they do take measures to lower their MLR now.",
            "In this brief, we estimate the number of enrollees whose insurer has waived cost-sharing – out-of-pocket costs including coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles – for COVID-19 treatment. We also estimate the number of enrollees whose insurer is offering various forms of premium payment relief. To do so, we reviewed a summary of private insurers’ responses to the pandemic compiled byAmerica’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). We systematically collected data from this summary and merged it onto enrollment data from Mark Farrah Associates TM in order to estimate how many individual and fully-insured group market enrollees are in plans that have waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment or are offering some form of premium relief.",
            "Importantly, our estimates do not include the substantial portion (61%) of the group market enrolled in self-insured plans through their employers. These plans are established and funded by an employer and are not always subject to federal regulation. As such, the benefit designs of these plans, including the services that they opt to cover and any associated cost-sharing, are left to the discretion of the employer. There is no source of comprehensive data on the prevalence of these policies and, therefore, they are not included in this analysis.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health Spending",
            "Federal legislation enacted in Marchrequiresthat all private insurance plans, including self-funded plans, cover the entire cost associated with approved COVID-19 tests so long as the test is deemed medically appropriate. However, there are no provisions that require private insurance plans to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment. Only five states (MA, NM, ID, MI, MN) and D.C. require insurers to waive out-of-pocket treatment costs for their fully-insured plan enrollees, though many insurers have voluntarily opted to waive out-of-pocket costs for enrollees who require COVID-19-related treatment.",
            "",
            "Across all individual and fully-insured group plans, 88% of enrollees are in a plan that has at some point during the pandemic waived out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 treatment. However, 20% of enrollees in these markets are in plans where that waiver has already expired and another 16% are in plans where it is currently set to expire by the end of September, leaving just 52% of enrollees with COVID-19 treatment cost-sharing waivers in October and beyond.  (Some plans have extended expiration dates already, and others may do so as their expiration date approaches). About a third (31%) of enrollees in the individual and fully-insured group markets are in plans that have waived cost-sharing on COVID-19 treatment for the remainder of the year, and another 15% are in plans where the expiration date of the waiver is unspecified or tied to the end of the designated public health emergency. Notably, most of these waivers only apply to COVID-19 treatment received from in-network providers or facilities and consumers who are treated out-of-network may be forced to pay the entire cost of their treatment.",
            "Included in these estimates are enrollees who live in one of the five states or the District of Columbia thatcurrently mandateall state-regulated insurers to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment, although the expiration dates of these mandates vary by state. Combined, these states account for 7% of the individual market and 9% of the fully-insured group market. Roughly 80% of enrollees in either market are in a plan that voluntarily waived cost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment at some point during the pandemic.",
            "Insurance companies are thus far quiteprofitabledue to arapid declinein overall healthcare utilization and spending since the start of the pandemic. Insurers are generally not allowed to reduce premiums owed in the middle of a plan year; however, CMS recently releasedguidanceallowing individual and small-group insurers to temporarily offer premiums credits to enrollees. Now, 11% of the individual market enrollees and 27% of fully-insured group market enrollees are in plans offering some form of premium credit or reduction.",
            "",
            "Insurers may also provide grace periods where individuals who do not pay their premiums on time do not face immediate cancellation of their policy. About 7% of enrollees in both markets are receiving grace periods to pay their premiums. A vast majority of these affected enrollees (representing 6 of the 7 percentage points) live in one of thethree states that currently requiregrace periods for premium payments, whereas plans that have voluntarily instituted grace periods represent only 1 out of 7 percentage points.",
            "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires individual and small-group insurers to spend at least 80% of their income from premium payments on health services, calculated on a three-year rolling average basis. If health insurers do not reach this threshold, referred to as the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR), they must reimburse their policy holders through rebates in the following plan year. Typically, rebates are not sent out until the fall after the plan year from which they are calculated, but CMSreleased guidancein June that allows health plans to “prepay” rebates to policy holders in order to help reduce the costs of premiums, and further clarified in anAugust 4th memothat the rebates can be in the form of premium credits or reductions. By the end of July, 2% of individual and fully-insured group market enrollees were in plans that had expedited rebate payments to qualifying enrollees.",
            "Motivated by higher-than-expected profits and some state requirements, many insurers have acted to offer financial relief to their enrollees, primarily through reduced COVID-19 treatment costs and less commonly through forms of premium relief and waivers on out-of-pocket costs for telehealth use. That said, many of these cost-sharing waivers have either expired or soon will, meaning more privately insured people will be exposed to high out-of-pocket costs associated with COVID-related treatment and hospitalization. Consumers who seek treatment for COVID-19 from out-of-network providers are also likely to face high costs for care, since most of these waivers only cover treatment from in-network providers. Also, 61% of covered workers are in self-insured plans that are not necessarily covered by these waivers. Self-funded employers ultimately decide whether to waive cost-sharing or not. Some insurers have said that self-funded employers could opt-out of the waived out-of-pocket costs, whereas other insurers allow employers to opt-in. It is not clear how many self-funded employers have waived these costs.",
            "Importantly, because of the substantial drop in overallhealthcare utilizationduring the last several months, insurers are still on-track to see considerable profits by the end of this year. This continued profitability means that, even with these cost-sharing waivers and premium relief measures, insurers may still owe enrollees substantial MLR rebates next year.",
            "We reviewed asummaryof private insurers responses to the pandemic, put together by America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the trade association representing private insurers. We systematically collected data from this summary as of July 31. For plans included in the AHIP summary, we merged on enrollment data as of the first quarter of 2020. Enrollment data were reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and compiled by Mark Farrah Associated TM. Individual market enrollment may contain trace amounts of CHIP enrollment. State actions on cost-sharing and premium policies were sourced from KFF’s tracker ofState Data and Policy Actions to Address Coronavirus, which is updated daily.",

            "This chart collection looks at the availability of hospital resources and healthcare professionals in the United States and similarly wealthy countries. Arelated chart collectionexamines how the U.S.’s healthcare resources factor into the nation’s preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "The availability of healthcare resources (e.g. medical professionals, technology, and other infrastructure) can affect the functioning of a health system in a variety of ways, including access to care, prices of services, and disaster preparedness. In a similar analysis, for example, we have examined how healthcare resources varywithin the U.S.to understand how prepared our health system was to handle a surge of COVID-19 patients.",
            "Overall, this chart collection shows that, on a per capita basis, the U.S. has more nurses but fewer physicians, hospitals, and acute care beds than comparable countries.",
            "The U.S. has fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than in most comparable countries, with the exception of Canada and Sweden. The number of acute hospital beds per 1,000 population fell in the U.S. from 3.0 in 2000 to 2.5 in 2017. Over the same period, the comparable country average declined from 5.4 to 4.2 beds per 1,000 population.",
            "In the past 17 years, the number of hospitals per capita has decreased in both the U.S. and similar countries, although the average density of hospitals in the U.S. has decreased more rapidly. From 1990 to 2017, the U.S. hospital density has decreased by about 28%, whereas the comparable country average has dropped by about 13%. In the U.S, fewer hospitals and higher rates of hospital consolidation areassociated with higher pricesbut not accompanying improvements in quality of care. Additionally, the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted that the availability of hospitals and hospitals beds ultimately contributes to a health system’s ability to treat patients and handle surges in hospital admissions.",
            "Some attention has been given recently to a potential doctor shortage in the U.S., particularly during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, during which certain hospitals were understaffed to treat the sudden surge in patients. The U.S. has fewer doctors per capita than comparable countries, except for Japan.",
            "In the past 18 years, the U.S. has seen comparably little growth in the number of practicing physicians per capita. While the number of physicians per capita has increased by about 34% since 2000 in similarly wealthy countries, growth in the U.S. was about 14%, leading to a widening gap between the U.S. and other OECD countries.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "The distribution of physicians in the U.S. is skewed heavily towards higher paid specialists versus general practitioners when compared with similar high-income countries. Only 12% of physicians in the U.S. are generalists.",
            "The numbers of psychiatrists, psychologists, and nurses per 100,000 population in the U.S. working in mental health are lower than the comparable country average. The rate of social workers per 100,000 population working in mental health in the U.S. is second to Canada, and more than other comparable countries where data is available.",
            "There is wide variation across comparable countries in the number of nurses licensed to practice per capita. The U.S. is on the higher end of this range with 17.6 licensed nurses per 1,000 population, slightly above the average for similarly wealthy countries (14.6 per 1,000 population).",
            "Both the U.S. and comparably wealthy OECD countries have seen growth in the number of nurses per capita since the year 2000. However, the U.S. has grown faster, increasing by about 22% from 2000 to 2018, as opposed to about 12% growth for comparable countries.",
            "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines are an example of technology that is used for increasing the accuracy of diagnosing medical conditions, though they are also associated with higher cost. While the full scope of resources a nation has can be difficult to measure, the OECD has data on the availability of MRI machines for certain countries.",
            "The U.S. has 40.4 MRI machines per million people, which is substantially more than most comparably wealthy countries except for Japan (55.2). The comparable country average is 22.3 MRI machines per million people. However, it should be noted that more MRI machines are not always associated with higher usage. For example, per OECD data, Austria, Germany and France all conduct similar numbers of MRI exams per capita when compared to the United States, despite having fewer machines.",

            "The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected the utilization of health services in the United States. In the early months of the pandemic, there was anabrupt and sizable decreasein spending on health services. However, a notable exception has been in the use of telehealth services, which has increased substantially during this time. In April 2020, one analysis found that13% of health care claim lineswere for telehealth services, up from 0.15% in April 2019. As discussed more in this brief, mental health services have accounted for a large share of telehealth visits, with multiple insurers reporting that over a third of telehealth visits were for mental health.",
            "To encourage social distancing and improve access to care during the pandemic, thefederal governmenthas issued guidance to private insurance plans encouraging the use of telehealth during the pandemic. Similarly,Medicarehas waived co-payments for beneficiaries and now pays providers the same rate for a telehealth visit as an office visit. In addition, since the start of the pandemic, many state governments have implemented new policies regarding telehealth usage in theirMedicaid programs.",
            "With these developments in mind, we reviewed a summary of private insurers’ responses to the pandemic, put together byAmerica’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). We systematically collected data from this summary and merged it onto enrollment data to better understand how private health insurers are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. We specifically focus on four policies or actions that promote telehealth usage: waiving cost-sharing for select telehealth services, offering or expanding telehealth access to mental health and/or substance use services, and instituting provider payment parity for telehealth. Using data from Mark Farrah Associates TM, we estimate how many individual market and fully-insured group market enrollees are in plans with these new telehealth policies. While some plans offered similar policies and benefits before the pandemic (e.g. coverage of mental health or substance use telehealth visits), these data reflect enrollees that are newly affected as a result of COVID-driven policy changes by insurers. Our estimates do not include the substantial portion (61%) of the group market enrolled in self-insured plans through their employers, because the benefit designs of these plans generally are left to the discretion of the employer.",
            "Waived cost-sharing.Over 30 million people are enrolled in individual market and fully-insured group plans that waived cost-sharing for all telehealth services (beyond COVID-19 testing and treatment) at some point during the pandemic.[1]38% of individual market enrollees are in a plan that has recently waived cost-sharing for non-COVID telehealth services, including 7% who live instates that currently mandate itand 31% who are enrolled in plans outside those states that did so voluntarily. Similarly, 52% of enrollees in the fully-insured group market are in a plan that has waived cost-sharing for telehealth services, 11% of whom live in a state that has currently mandated it and 41% in plans outside those states that did so voluntarily.",
            "Telehealth coverage includes mental health and/or substance use visits.At least 30 health plans have started including mental health and/or substance use visits in their allowable telehealth services since the start of the pandemic. Combined, these plans cover 45% of enrollees in the individual market and 33% in the fully-insured group market.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Expanded mental health and/or substance use telehealth services or providers.AHIP identifies 15 health plans that expanded access to mental health and/or substance use via telehealth at some point during the pandemic, including adding new providers or contracting with companies that offer counseling services via telehealth. These plans cover 24% of enrollees in the individual market and 10% in the group market. For example, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts reported that almost half of their telehealth visits since the pandemic began have been for mental health services. To meet the demand, they added more than 400 mental health clinicians to its network since March 1, increasing the number of mental health clinicians to nearly 15,000.",
            "Telehealth provider payment parity.More than 17 million enrollees are in private plans that are paying providers the same rate for telehealth visits as office visits, often referred to as provider payment parity. About a third (32%) of individual market enrollees are in a plan with telehealth provider payment parity, including 27% who live instates that currently mandate itand 5% who are enrolled in plans outside those states that did so voluntarily. Similarly, a quarter (25%) of enrollees in the fully-insured group market are in a plan that has instituted telehealth provider parity, 22% of whom live in a state that has currently mandated it and 3% in plans outside those states that did so voluntarily. Payment parity between telehealth and office visits can expand access and capacity, but it also assists providers who lost significant revenue with the stay-at-home orders andaccompanying deferral of many health services.",
            "Proponents of telehealth havelong-advocatedthat the increased use of telehealth services can improve access and outcomes for patients, decrease costs, and facilitate the sharing of information between healthcare professionals. However,many barriershave impeded the expansion of telehealth services in the U.S., including the highly regulated and fragmented healthcare system, technology challenges, reimbursement issues, and provider resistance.",
            "Althoughmost employer planscovered telemedicine services before the pandemic, use of these services had been quite low. While the increase in telehealth has not offset the drop in in-person visits, the pandemic has created significant policy changes that overcame existing barriers and could potentially lead to a lasting uptake in telehealth. Overall, it is unclear whether we will continue to see high rates of telehealth utilization once the pandemic is over. Many of the policies enacted for private insurance plans have sunset dates, though several have extended the policies, some through the end of 2020 or until the public emergency is over.",
            "If telemedicine use continues to pick up as a result of the pandemic, this could have implications for health spending and outcomes. On one hand, if providers are reimbursed at lower rates, telehealth could offer savings. On the other hand, there may be concerns that these services could be additive (increasing health utilization overall) rather than just replacing in-person visits. Another important question for researchers and policymakers to continue monitoring is whether telehealth services are providing care that can truly replace in-person visits.",
            "We reviewed asummaryof private insurers responses to the pandemic, put together by America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the trade association representing private insurers. We systematically collected data from this summary as of July 13. For plans included in the AHIP summary, we merged on enrollment data as of the first quarter of 2020. Enrollment data were reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and compiled by Mark Farrah Associated TM. State actions on telehealth policies were sourced from KFF’s tracker ofState Data and Policy Actions to Address Coronavirus, which is updated daily.",
            "[1]There are many more people enrolled in self-funded plans that may have also received these benefits, but we do not include them in this analysis as the decision generally is left to the employer and there is no systematic collection of data on employer decisions.",

            "The recent increase in COVID-19 cases is straining some parts of the U.S. health system due in part to the limited availability of hospital beds inhard hit communitiesand the simultaneous return of certain services that were delayed at the onset of the pandemic. Some hospitals alreadylack the resourcesto handle an influx of COVID-19 patients.",
            "In searching for solutions to the lack of beds, equipment, and personnel to treat patients with COVID-19 and other conditions, cities and states have turned to a variety options, including the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VHA, which operates the largest integrated health system in the country, is statutorily required to back-up the nation’s health system in times of public emergencies. Within the context of the coronavirus pandemic, this brief examines the role of the VHA during public health emergencies and its capacity to support the broader community if called upon. We find that the VHA offered additional hospital capacity to a small number of strained communities during the first months of the pandemic, but that VHA support to the non-Veteran community has become increasingly more widespread and varied as the pandemic has progressed and placed sustained pressure on local health systems.",
            "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)operatesthe country’s largest integrated healthcare system, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which includes more than 150 hospitals and over 1,000 outpatient clinics across the country. Combined,these hospitalshave a total of over 13,000 acute care beds, 1,800 of which are intensive care beds. According to the VA Secretary’s office, the VHA began working to expand capacity during the early days of the pandemic, resulting in the creation of 1,000 additional ICU beds in the system. Compared to many community hospitals, VHA hospitalshave additional equipment and specialized care facilities, such as negative pressure rooms used for treatment of patients with infectious diseases like COVID-19. The VA has diagnosed over 33,000 COVID-19 cases among veterans and VA employees, but inpatient admission rates at VA medical centers aresignificantly lower than their pre-pandemic levelsdue to patients generally avoiding hospitals out of fears of contracting the virus and the VAs efforts to transition many services to telehealth.",
            "The operations of the VA fall within the scope of four “missions.” The first three relate to services provided directly to veterans and their families. The “Fourth Mission,” as it is known, deals with improving the nation’s preparedness to respond to national emergencies, disasters, and war. The VA has previously acted under this mission to provide medical resources to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Irma, for example, and to supply mobile care units in Orlando after the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse nightclub.",
            "The VA’s “Fourth Mission” directs the VHA to act as a safety net for the nation’s private healthcare system, providing extra capacity and resources should community hospitals become overwhelmed. Under theNational Response Framework, an interagency plan coordinating the federal response to emergencies, the VA can be tasked with two Essential Support Functions that can support the response to COVID-19: sharing healthcare resources with the community and/or providing care to non-enrolled veterans or non-veterans. Under the National Response Framework, federal, state, or local officials can request that HHS operationalize the VHA to provide these community and non-veteran services. Typical requests include a lack of needed supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), hospital beds, or medications. Importantly, veteran enrollees still take priority and the VA can only provide these support services if it can first handle the strain from veterans with COVID-19 and ensure continuity of care for non-infected veterans.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health Spending",
            "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the VA is executing these support functions in several ways. As of July 20, the VA was supporting46 states and the District of Columbiain their COVID-19 responses, including providing additional tests and/or equipment in 17 states, opening beds to care for non-veteran patients in 14 states, and providing additional staff in several more states. In April, the Secretary of the VAindicatedto FEMA that the VHA could provide up to 1,500 beds for missions in the community, including 500 ICU beds. So far, 279 non-veteran COVID-19 patients have been admitted to VHA facilities.",
            "The first instance where the VHA bolstered local hospital capacity came in late March when, after a request from the state of New York, the VHAopened 50 hospital beds(35 acute care and 15 intensive care unit beds) to non-veteran, non-COVID-19 patients. In the time since, VHA facilities in 13 other states have made hospital beds available for some non-veteran patients (Arizona, California, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington). During the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, VA medical centers in coronavirus hotspots, like Phoenix and South Texas, havereported transferringnon-COVID patients to different VA medical centers in preparation for increasing COVID-hospitalizations from veterans and potentially non-veteran patients. The VHA has also dispatched more than 750 doctors, nurses, or other staff to aid non-VA facilities in Florida, New Jersey, Alabama, California, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Tennessee.",
            "The VHA could be a resource to expand capacity in states and localities strained by the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases, as shown by the VHA’s current support of some affected areas. However, the VHA may face limitations that could challenge their ability to successfully activate the “Fourth Mission” and provide capacity and support across different communities.",
            "Like other hospitals during the pandemic, VHA facilities may face their own workforce and resource shortages. However, the VHA has made progress towards filling positions since the start of the pandemic,reportingthat 5,285 registered nurses have been hired and onboarded since March.",
            "VA medical centers are also primarily concentrated in metropolitan centers and the Northeast. As of 2015, only 25 VA medical centers weredesignated as rural,and while the VHA has outpatient clinics and other smaller facilities to care for veterans in rural areas, these facilities lack the beds and equipment to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Consequently, although VA resources could improve overall capacity, rural communities may benefit less, particularly outside of the Northeast. This disparity is especially important because the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural communities have grown more quickly than in urban communities since April, and rural hospitals haveless capacityand fewer alternatives to adapt if they become overwhelmed.",

            "To monitor the performance of the U.S. health system, ourHealth System Dashboardincludes more than 50 indicators across four domains: health spending, quality of care, access & affordability, and health & wellbeing. The dashboard examines trends in the U.S. health system, compares the U.S. to a group of other similarly large and wealthy countries (identified based on median GDP and median GDP per capita), and highlights differences across demographic characteristics. In this brief, we look at the bigger picture of what these data convey about how well the health system is performing, and how the coronavirus pandemic may affect key indicators.",
            "Broadly speaking, health outcomes and quality of care in the U.S. have improved in many areas, although often more slowly than comparable countries and with some recent worsening. In recent years, indicators of longevity and disease burden have worsened in the U.S., partly driven by the opioid crisis. While many comparable countries saw slight declines in life expectancy in 2015, those countries have since rebounded. The U.S. life expectancy rate, however, has plateaued and dropped since 2014. With respect to spending, the rate of health spending growth in the U.S. has recently slowed and is now similar to comparable countries, although the U.S. continues to spend much more on healthcare, both as a percent of GDP and per person. Healthcare access and affordability has continued to improve on gains made under the Affordable Care Act.",
            "Importantly, the coronavirus pandemic and corresponding economic crisis threatens to exacerbate recent declines. While the exact impact is not yet known, effects from the crises may worsen health outcomes and disparities, increase the uninsured rate in the U.S., and lower life expectancy.",
            "Based on data available through 2018 or earlier years, the following findings highlight recent trends across 10 key indicators of health system performance and outline potential effects of the pandemic and economic downturn.Visit the Health System Dashboardfor more in-depth exploration of these and other telling analyses.",
            "HEALTH & WELLBEING",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "1.Life expectancyat birth generally improved over the past several decades in the U.S., rising by 4.9 years since 1980. However, life expectancy has declined slightly in recent years, driven by increased mortality rates forcertain causes, including drug overdoses and suicides. Furthermore, comparable countries have an average life expectancy of 82.3 years – nearly four years longer than the U.S. life expectancy of 78.6 years – and the gap is growing. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and although its full impact will take time to assess, the death toll could reduce average life expectancy in the U.S. and other countries. Additionally, the pandemic has exacerbated inequalities underlying long-standing health disparities, and it has thus disproportionately affected Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, and Hispanic communities. Any impact it has on life expectancy may be more pronounced among these groups.",
            "2.Disease burden, a measure that accounts for both longevity and quality of life, has improved over the past quarter century, dropping 12% between 1990 and 2017, with particular improvement for circulatory diseases. However, in the past few years the disease burden rate has worsened in the U.S. (driven by substance use disorders and an uptick in injuries) while continuing to improve in similar countries. As of 2017, disease burden was higher in the U.S. than in any other comparable country. Importantly, the U.S. has relatively high rates of disease burden attributable to some of the health conditions that put people at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19: cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Though data are not yet available, the pandemic is likely to increase disease burden in all countries as more people contract the virus.",
            "QUALITY OF CARE",
            "3. Despite some progress, the U.S. continues to lag behind comparable countries in preventing deaths that in many cases could have been averted by timely and effective healthcare. TheHealthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Indexreflects the rate ofdeaths amenable to healthcarewith a score from zero (lower quality) to 100 (higher quality). The U.S. has an HAQ Index rating of 88.7, ranking the lowest among comparable countries (average a score of 93.7). Although the U.S. has made progress in reducing deaths amenable to healthcare, this improvement has not kept pace with similar countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened hospitals in certain parts of the U.S. and several other countries, which will make it more difficult forsome patientsto access timely care and, as a result, potentially worsen the rate of deaths amenable to healthcare.",
            "4. Compared to the average of comparable countries,potentially preventable hospital admissionsrates are higher in the U.S. for several diseases that could possibly be prevented or treated in a non-emergency setting, including for congestive heart failure (88% higher), asthma (8% higher), and diabetes (53% higher). Hypertension is an exception, as U.S. admission rates are 12% lower than the comparable country average. While the U.S. rate of potentially preventable hospital admissions has improved over the time (decreasing 32% from 2000 to 2015), hospitalizations from COVID-19 may outweigh these gains. Additionally, the pandemic may limit access and use of preventive care that helps reduce hospital admissions.",
            "5. The occurrence ofhospital-acquired conditions(e.g., surgical infections or medication errors) has improved, declining 13% from 2014 to 2017. It is not clear if the pandemic will impact the rate of hospital-acquired conditions. However, the new coronavirus currently poses an infection risk for both hospital patients and staff, particularly if there is limited availability of personal protective equipment.",
            "ACCESS & AFFORDABILITY",
            "6. Due to gains inhealth coverageas a result of the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate among the nonelderly dropped from 18% in 2010 to 11% in 2018. Even with about 90% of the total U.S. population now insured and with coverage trending upward prior to the pandemic, the U.S. coverage rate is lowest among comparable countries, most of which have universal coverage. Further, the U.S. uninsured rate may rise as people lose employer-based coverage because of the pandemic and associated economic downturn.",
            "7. Fewer adults are reportingproblems paying medical bills. From 2011 to 2018, the share of people reporting difficulty paying medical bills dropped by more than a quarter. However, medical bills remain a top concern for many Americans, and this could worsen with the pandemic. Recent legislation made COVID-19 testing free at the point of service, and many insurers initially waived cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment, making it an option for self-insured employers (who cover most people with employer-based coverage) to offer the benefit. However, some of these insurers stopped waiving cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment in June. Additionally, the Department of Health and Human Services indicated it intends to coveruncompensated COVID-19 carefor uninsured patients through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act Provider Relief Fund. Nonetheless, individuals – specifically those who areuninsured– may still face unaffordable medical bills for any treatment they receive. KFF analysis has found that the total cost of an inpatient admission for severe COVID-19 could beover $88,000in the large employer market, and that out-of-pocket costs for these enrollees could exceed $1,300.",
            "8. While the share of adultsdelaying or foregoing needed caredue to costs dropped 4 percentage points from 2009 to 2017, there was a small increase from 2017 to 2018. COVID-19 may portend additional increases if there  are widespread barriers to accessing testing and treatment for COVID-19. Additionally, greaterjob or income losswill create more strained financial resources for many individuals and families.",
            "HEALTH SPENDING",
            "9.Health spendingper person has grown steeply from $355 per capita in 1970 to $11,172 in 2018. On average, other wealthy countries spend less than half as much per person. This spending differential is primarily because ofhigher pricesfor healthcare in the U.S., asutilizationis similar – and in some cases lower – in the U.S. For the last decade though, per capita spending in the U.S. has grown at an average rate of 3.6% per year, which issimilarto that of comparable countries. It is unclear how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect health spending overall. While the costs of care related to the pandemic will be high, the pandemic has also resulted in widespread cancellation or postponement of regularly scheduled treatments, such as elective procedures, preventive care, and other non-urgent care. These delays and cancellations have a downward effect on total health spending that may offset at least some of the high cost of treating patients with COVID-19.",
            "10. Health spending has historicallygrown faster than the economy, but the difference has moderated in recent years. U.S. health consumption expenditures accounted for 17.7% of GDP in 2018 – much more than comparable countries, where health spending averages 10.4% of GDP. Both GDP and health spending will likely change because of the pandemic. People also tend to use less healthcare during times of economic downturn, resulting in slower health spending growth.",
            "DISPARITIES IN HEALTH SYSTEM PERFORMANCE",
            "Although there is general improvement across many indicators, there are oftendisparitiesacross racial or ethnic groups, genders, age, health status, and income levels. In 2017, whilelife expectancyamong White people in the U.S. was similar to the national average of 78.6 years, life expectancy was 3.7 years shorter than average among Black people and 3.2 years longer among Hispanic people. In 2018, 15.4% of all non-elderly adults reported difficulty paying medical bills, with a substantial gap between lower- and higher-income adults: 23.3% of those who earn below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level reporteddifficulty paying medical bills, compared to 11.6% of those earning 200% FPL and above. Where possible, dashboard data are broken out across demographic groups to highlight these disparities. These and other health disparities may very well worsen due to the pandemic. COVID-19 and the economic downturn has disproportionately impacted Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Hispanic, and low-income people in the U.S.",
            "Some cross-national differences in health outcomes and costs may be due to a variety of social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health and are not solely or directly influenced by the health system.

            "The dashboard is a starting point for exploring unfolding trends, and it is important to keep in mind that not all indicators will change at the same pace, particularly with so many unknowns surrounding the current pandemic and economic crisis.Visit the Health System Dashboardfor a more in-depth exploration of these other telling trends.",
            "Where possible, we compare the U.S. to other similarly large and wealthy countries as measured by median GDP and median GDP per capita. These countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.",
            "Data were collected and analyzed by researchers at KFF using a variety of data sources (which can be found for specific indicators in the indicator page on the dashboard). The dashboard includes more than 50 indicators of health system performance, organized into four domains – a structure based largely on the framework put forth in the National Academy of Medicine’s 2015 Vital Signs: Core Metrics for Health and Health Care Progress. Indicators on the dashboard were selected through consultation with other experts in the field and a review of various additional sources of data on quality and outcomes measurement, including (among others): National Quality Forum; Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS); Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS); America’s Health Rankings; Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA); CMS Hospital Compare; US News and World Report; America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP)/CMS Core Quality Measures Collaborative; Commonwealth Fund; as well as a review of sources for data on health spending, such as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index is a metric developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and based on the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.",
            "The dashboard is limited to some extent by what data are available at the health system level, particularly for indicators of health system quality (see our in-depth discussionhere). While health spending, access, and health status data are more readily available and standardized, some indicators of quality of care are less standardized and often only available nationally for the Medicare population. The quality measures included in the dashboard were selected through consultation with a number of experts in the field and present a comprehensive look at treatment outcomes, patient safety, appropriateness of treatments, use of preventive services, and the resources of the health system.",

            "The coronavirus outbreak has hit densely populated urban areas of the United States first and hardest. Some health systems have experienced surges of patients, raising concerns that there are not enough hospital beds, staffing, and equipment.",
            "The novel coronavirus was slower to spread to rural areas in the U.S., but that appears to be changing, with new outbreaks becoming evident in less densely populated parts of the country. In this brief, we analyze variation in hospital bed capacity by region in the U.S. and by metro/non-metro status. In total, 14% of the population lives in a non-metro area. These non-metro areas are largely rural, and, even prior to the pandemic, face different challenges in health system capacity, including further travel times for patients and provider shortages. Lastly, we examine metro and non-metro differences in the share of the population that is at increased risk of COVID-19 due to age or health status.",
            "Although metro and non-metro areas have a similar number of hospital beds per capita, we find that non-metro areas have fewer ICU beds as metro areas (1.7 versus 2.8 beds per 10,000 population). Additionally, a larger share of the population living in non-metro areas are age 65 and over or have pre-existing conditions. Older adults are atincreased riskof hospitalization from COVID-19 and are more likely to require intensive care. To account for the older populations in non-metro areas, we also age-adjust the number of hospital beds per capita, relative to the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization by age group (see methods for more details). After adjusting for population age, we find that differences in ICU capacity between non-metro and metro areas become more pronounced (1.6 beds per age-adjusted population vs 2.9 beds) and that non-metro areas have about 10% fewer hospital beds per age-adjusted 10,000 population (21.6) than metro areas (23.9).",
            "If the coronavirus continues to spread in non-metro areas, these health systems could be even more strained than metro areas. While efforts such as relocating healthcare professionals and constructing temporary hospitals can alleviate some shortages, the existing capacity of hospitals will be an important factor as other parts of the country experience peak demand.",
            "Across the U.S., there is an average of 23.5 hospital beds and 2.7 ICU beds per 10,000 population. As shown in an earlieranalysis, the U.S. has fewer hospital beds per capita than most similarly large and wealthy countries, including some other countries whose health systems have been overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. One way to examine the patient capacity per hospital is by Hospital Referral Regions (HRR), which are geographic areas representing the common utilization pattern of the nation’s roughly 4,500 community, non-federal, and critical access hospitals. HRRs vary in size based on the typical distance that the population has to travel to the use hospital services.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "Healthcare resources vary greatly across the U.S. Some HRRs have fewer than one ICU bed per 10,000 population, including the areas around Santa Cruz, California (0.8); Fort Collins, Colorado (0.9); Minot, North Dakota (0.9); and Wichita Falls, Texas (0.9). Meanwhile, others have more than six ICU beds per 10,000 population: Rochester, Minnesota (8.6); Colorado Springs, Colorado (7.3); Florence, South Carolina (6.9); and Tuscaloosa, Alabama (6.6).",
            "The number of total hospital beds by HRR ranges from roughly 10 per 10,000 population in areas like Longview, Texas (9.6); Arlington, Virginia (11.6); and Mesa, Arizona (12.1) to well over 60 per 10,000 population in Grand Forks, North Dakota (86.9); Meridian, Mississippi (79.5); and Rochester, Minnesota (65.8).",
            "For context, the Manhattan HRR, which includes the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, ranks slightly above average, with 31.6 hospital beds and 2.8 ICU beds per 10,000 population, as of 2018.",
            "Of particular concern is the patient capacity of health systems in rural areas. We used the method suggested by the US Department of Agriculture to categorize metro areas as places where over half the population lives in a metro center (see Methods). We then grouped these areas by state. For example, metro Colorado includes the areas around Denver, Colorado Springs, and Grand Junction. Non-metro Colorado includes predominantly rural areas in the state.",
            "In total, there are roughly ten times as many ICU beds located in metro areas (77,642) as in non-metro areas (7,605). On average, non-metro areas have 1.7 ICU beds per 10,000 population, compared to 2.8 beds per 10,000 population in metro areas. Non-metro areas of Colorado have 8.1 ICU beds per 10,000 population, but there is a steep decline when comparing this to the non-metro areas of other states. New Hampshire has the second highest number of ICU beds per capita in non-metro areas at 2.8 per 10,000 population, followed by South Carolina and Kentucky which both have 2.6 ICU beds per 10,000 population in non-metro areas.",
            "The metro areas in North Dakota (6.1), D.C. (6.0), West Virginia (4.6) and Alabama (4.6) have relatively high numbers of ICU beds per 10,000 population, but metro areas in Hawaii (1.7), California (2.1), and Maryland (2.1) have closer to two ICU beds per 10,000 population.",
            "In the case of Wyoming and New Hampshire, non-metro areas have more ICU beds per capita than metro areas. Non-metro areas of Wyoming and New Hampshire have 1.9 and 2.8 beds per 10,000 population, respectively, compared to 1.6 and 1.4 beds per 10,000 population in metro areas of the states.",
            "The map below allows you to explore variation in total hospital bed capacity and ICU bed capacity across metro and non-metro areas, as well as how these estimates change when accounting for the age of the population.",
            "Older adults are more likely torequire hospitalizationif they become infected with coronavirus and develop COVID-19. According todatafrom the CDC, older adults infected with coronavirus had the highest hospitalization rate of 13.8 per 100,000 population, compared to 7.4 per 100,000 among adults ages 50 to 64 and 2.5 per 100,000 among adults ages 18 to 49. Older adults are also more likely to experience severe illness, potentially requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, younger adults who have certain pre-existing conditions are also at increased risk of more severe illness if infected with coronavirus.",
            "Non-metro areas not only have fewer ICU beds per capita on average, but also have older and sicker populations. We find that 20% of people living in non-metro areas are over age 65, compared to 15% of people living in metro areas. Using the methodology described in an earlier KFFanalysisof people with illnesses putting them at increased risk if they develop COVID-19, we also find that people under age 65 living in non-metro areas are more likely to have these pre-existing health conditions (26%) than are non-elderly people living in metro areas (20%).",
            "To further examine how capacity in non-metro areas compares to metro areas, we age-adjusted the population by the share of hospitalization for COVID-19. The hospital resource disparities between metro and non-metro areas in the U.S. grow larger when adjusting for population age. On an age-adjusted basis, non-metro areas have just over half as many ICU beds as metro areas, and about ten percent fewer hospitals beds. On average, metro areas have 23.9 hospital beds per 10,000 age-adjusted population, compared to 21.6 beds in non-metro areas. Metro areas have an average of 2.9 ICU beds per 10,000 age-adjusted population, compared to 1.6 ICU beds in non-metro areas in the U.S.",
            "For context, the Manhattan HRR, which includes Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, ranks relatively high with 32.7 hospital beds and 2.9 ICU beds per 10,000 age-adjusted population.",
            "The availability of hospital and ICU beds varies drastically across the country and within states. On average, non-metro areas of the U.S. have a similar number of inpatient hospital beds as metro areas, but fewer ICU beds. Non-metro populations are more likely to be older or have health conditions that put them at an increased risk of complications from COVID-19. When adjusting for age, compared to metro areas, non-metro areas have just over half (55%) the number of ICU beds, which are needed to care for the most severe cases of COVID-19.",
            "If coronavirus continues to spread in rural communities across the U.S., it is possible many of these areas will face shortages of ICU beds with limited options to adapt. Patients in rural areas experiencing more severe illnesses may be transferred to hospitals with greater capacity, but if nearby urban areas are also overwhelmed, transfer may not be an option. Cities and states may increase their hospitals’ patient capacity by freeing up beds used for elective procedures or repurposing space likeNew York has done. However, rural areas already lacking in hospital resources and staff will have a difficult time adding capacity if they see an increase in coronavirus cases.",
            "This brief is based on an analysis of the 2018 American Hospital Association (AHA), American Hospital Directory (AHD), the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) data, and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Following the methodology developed by Tsai et al., the analysis includes non-federal, community, critical access hospitals.[i]In addition, hospitals in Panama City, Florida were excluded due to data irregularities. The total sum of ICU beds comes from the AHD, and includes: trauma, surgical, coronary, burn, and all general ICU beds. Neonatal, psychiatric, and pediatric ICUs were not included in the definition of ICU beds. In total, there were 4,438 hospitals included in the analysis across all 50 states and DC with over 85,000 ICU beds.",
            "Hospital Referral Regions (HRR) are geographic areas, defined by theDartmouth Atlasto reflect the typical referral patterns for hospitals. HRRs must contain a neurosurgical and cardiovascular surgical center, and are defined by the usage patterns of Medicare beneficiaries. Select areas of the country, such as portions of northwest Maine and southern Florida, do not have associated HRRs because the Dartmouth Atlas has labeled them as ‘not populated’ due to insufficient data. The ACS divides the United States intoPublic Use Microdata Areas(PUMAs), or geographic areas representing at least 100,000 people. PUMA’s vary in size based on population density. A crosswalk from the Missouri Data Center was used to map PUMAs to HRRs. In cases where a PUMA lay across multiple HRRs, all people in the HRR were assigned to the HRR with the largest share of the PUMA’s population. Population totals were calculated within HRR using the ACS.",
            "Metro and non-metro areas are defined by theUSDA Economic Research Service. Using the USDA method, 80% of the PUMAs were solely in non-metro areas, 9% contain metro areas, and 12% contained both metro and non-metro areas. The remaining PUMAs were categorized based on where the majority of the population lives. In total, 14% of the population lives in a PUMA which was classified as non-metro.",
            "To account for differences in the age of the population, we also calculated beds per capita using age-adjusted metro and non-metro population estimates. To do so, we age-standardized the population to CDC’s estimates of the share ofCOVID-19 hospitalizations by age.",

            "As the coronavirus spreads rapidly across the United States, private health insurers and government health programs could potentially face higher health care costs. However, the extent to which costs grow, and how the burden is distributed across payers, programs, individuals, and geography are still very much unknown. This brief lays out a framework for understanding changes in health costs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including the factors driving health costs upward and downward. We also highlight some special considerations for private insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid programs.",
            "The most direct impact the coronavirus pandemic will have on U.S. health care spending is through testing and treatment of COVID-19, but the extent of upward pressure on health costs depends on a number of still unknown factors.",
            "One of the most important and yet still unknown factors driving health care costs is the number and severity of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. Projections vary, and are largely dependent on the success of public health efforts to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus. The University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)modelsuggests the outbreak is reaching its peak in the U.S., but others have warned of the possibility of another spike in cases if social distancing measures are relaxed too soon this summer, or possibly anotheroutbreakthis fall or winter. Particularly for private insurers and Medicaid programs, the geographic distribution of infections across states will also have important consequences for premiums and state budgets, discussed in more detail below.",
            "Currently treatment is supportive, not curative. Some COVID-19 patients are enrolled in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of certain antiviral drugs, and human trials have begun to test the effectiveness of vaccines. If an effective treatment is identified soon, this could significantly reduce the strain of coronavirus on the health system, but the costs of any new drug treatments could add new costs to the system, affecting both public programs and private payers. Vaccines are not expected to be available for at least a year. While vaccines will prevent future cases and thus future spending, the vaccine will come at a cost as well.",
            "Roughly 15% of people infected by the coronavirus could requirehospitalization, and a small share require invasive mechanical ventilation. The cost of these admissions will vary by severity and payer. In an earlieranalysis, we estimate that, among people insured through a large employer’s private health plan, hospitalization for pneumonia ranged from an average of $9,763 to $20,292 in 2018 depending on severity and comorbidities associated with the condition. However, patients who need to be put on a ventilator would have much higher costs. In 2018, ventilation treatment for respiratory conditions ranged from $34,223 to $88,114 depending on the length of time ventilation is required, for patients in large employer plans. Treatment costs on a per patient basis for comparable admissions will be lower in Medicare and Medicaid, where providers are reimbursed at lower rates. For example, average hospital payments for pneumonia with major comorbidities or complications are $10,010 under Medicare, and hospitalizations for respiratory system infections requiring ventilator support are $40,218. Under the CARES Act, Medicare will pay a 20% premium for COVID-19 treatment, but per admission payment is still less than that for the same type of admission for people with private plans, on average.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health Spending",
            "Testing will likely involve relatively low costs on a per-test basis. Medicare, for example, pays $36 to $51 for each test. As testing becomes more widespread, though, the total cost will add up significantly. Hospitals and labs are now required to post the cost of coronavirus tests, and insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid are required to cover the tests without cost-sharing to the patient.",
            "Covered California published the first nationalestimatesof COVID-19 treatment and testing costs, ranging from $34 to $251 billion for commercial insurers (not including people enrolled in Medicare Advantage or Medicaid Managed Care Plans). America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) in consultation with Wakely, recently produced baselineestimates(assuming a 20% infection rate) of $84 to $139 billion in 2020 and $28 to $46 billion in 2021 for the direct cost of coronavirus testing and treatment of COVID-19, by private insurers (including commercial insurers, Medicaid MCOs and Medicare Advantage plans). However, using different assumptions of infection rates would yield widely different costs, ranging from a total of $56 to $556 billion over the two-year time period. The AHIP estimates do not include spending on Medicare beneficiaries in traditional Medicare. In aFAIR Healthanalysis of private, Medicare and Medicaid claims, estimates of total COVID-19 treatment costs ranged from $139 billion to $558 billion. The range of these estimates is indicative of the uncertainty around how many people will become infected and how many will need hospitalization.",
            "An indirect effect of the coronavirus outbreak is the additional strain on limited hospital resources, which will lead to some care being delayed or forgone. Additionally, due to both social distancing measures and the economic downturn, individuals may also forgo outpatient care or prescription drugs they would have otherwise used. Forgone care could offset some of the additional costs of treating people with COVID-19, though the degree costs are offset is still a question.",
            "The IHME model suggests the number of people needing hospitalization could exceed the number of available hospital beds for some time to come in parts of the country. Hospitals in the U.S. are canceling or delaying some elective procedures to leave more beds, equipment, and staffing available for treating patients with COVID-19.",
            "Elective care generally refers to any care that is not urgent, but many so-called elective procedures are nonetheless lifesaving or can significantly improve quality of life. Hospitals in the U.S. appear to be making different decisions about whether and which care to delay, making it difficult to model the cost effects. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), have release broad guidelines recommending procedures to be delayed. Additionally, some other types of hospitalizations may be avoided or delayed beyond just surgical procedures.",
            "To understand the potential impact of delayed and forgone care and considerations insurers face in setting premiums for next year, we analyzed claims data from non-elderly enrollees of large employer plans using a sample of the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database. In 2018, 37% of hospital admission spending by large employer plans was on surgical procedures that did not originate in the emergency room, some of which may be delayed or forgone. Some of the surgical admissions that do not originate in the emergency room are nonetheless time-sensitive and life-saving. As hospitals across the U.S. are making differing decisions about which procedures to go forward with, often on a case-by-case basis, it is not yet possible to say how much of this or other hospital spending will be canceled or deferred into next year, but it gives a sense of the uncertainty and assumptions insurers may make in setting premiums for next year.",
            "Although most forgone care is likely to put downward pressure on health costs this year, at least for several months, the delayed procedures and costs could shift to the next calendar year, raising spending for 2021. There is additionally some concern that certain types of delayed care could worsen health outcomes and cause higher spending later. For example, delaying or forgoing chronic disease management, either because of reduced access to medical providers or pharmacy services, could lead to more complications later.",
            "Private insurers face particular challenges in predicting their costs, as there are still many unknowns around policymaking relating to cost-sharing requirements and risk mitigation programs. As the AHIP estimates demonstrate, the range of possible costs could vary ten-fold depending on the severity of the outbreak, not to mention additional unknowns such as the number and types of elective procedure delays, amount of pent-up demand, and uncertainty over policy changes.",
            "Commercial insurers must submit premiums for 2021 to state regulators for review and approval in the next two months. In their premium calculations, insurers are not allowed to justify future premium increases based on any losses they expect this year. Instead, premium justifications must be based on assumptions about claims costs for next calendar year. If claims costs are exceptionally high this year, though, insurers might need to replenish surplus in order to remain solvent. Once finalized, in late summer, premiums will be locked in and insurers will be unable to change those rates for the duration of the coming calendar year.",
            "The consequences of guessing wrong could be dire for some insurers. Insurers may have an incentive to over-price their plans, particularly on the individual market where many enrollees are subsidized and sheltered from premium increases. State regulators could encourage insurers to make similar assumptions about COVID-19 costs and pent-up demand so that premiums are not radically different from each other simply based on differing assumptions. However, the uncertainty around premium setting could also lead some insurers to decide not to offer coverage next year. In past years, when there was uncertainty around premium setting, some parts of the country were at risk of having no insurer offering exchange coverage.",
            "Congress has not passed a risk mitigation program for private insurers in light of COVID-19. However, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) included two temporarymarket stabilization programsin its early years that could serve as models. Reinsurance would protect insurers against losses from extremely high-cost enrollees and a risk corridors program would protect against extreme gains or losses from inaccurate premium setting.",
            "Reinsurance works by reimbursing insurers for a portion of claims cost for each enrollee that exceeds a certain threshold. If an enrollee’s costs exceed a certain threshold, called an attachment point, the plan is eligible for payment up to the reinsurance cap. Under the ACA, attachment points were set at $45,000 in the initial years of the program. As the program is intended to reimburse for extremely high cost individuals, and many COVID-19 patients will have hospitalizations that cost in the $20,000 range, reinsurance as designed under the ACA would have missed many of these enrollees and would likely only reimburse for those COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care or ventilation. The program could be altered to include condition-based reimbursement, but it would not address mispricing due to incorrect assumptions about non-COVID care like elective procedures being delayed or forgone.",
            "A risk corridors program would more directly address concerns of mispricing, including inaccurate assumptions about delayed elective procedures and pent-up demand beyond COVID-19 treatment, by limiting losses and gains beyond an allowable range. The federal government would share in the gains and losses of private insurers that set premiums too high or too low. Under the ACA’s risk corridors program, insurers whose claims costs were lower than expected by more than 3% paid into the program, and those whose claims costs were higher than expected by more than 3% received funds from the program. If an insurer’s claims fell within plus or minus three percent of their target amount, the plan made no payments into the risk corridor program and received no payments from it. In other words, insurers would still experience some gains and losses, but both would be limited.",
            "For private insurance enrollees, out-of-pocket costs remain a concern. Some insurers have voluntarilywaivedcost-sharing for COVID-19 treatment, and a mandate has been proposed though not passed at the federal level. For those whose costs are not waived, we haveestimatedthat out-of-pocket costs for a COVID-19 hospitalization could exceed $1,300 for people who are insured by a large employer. Out-of-pocket costs would likely be higher for people covered by small businesses and individual market plans, as those plans tend to have higher deductibles.",
            "Older adults are at particularly high risk for COVID-19 complications and death, and virtually all adults ages 65 and older are covered by the Medicare program. While it is possible that Medicare spending will increase above projected baseline spending for 2020, the magnitude of that increase, and the longer-term impact, is not clear. Increases in Medicare spending would have spillover effects for Medicare beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket spending in future years, in the form of higher premiums, deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements.",
            "The pandemic is likely to put upward pressure on Medicare spending due to the following factors: the number of Medicare-covered COVID-19 hospitalizations; how much Medicare pays to treat COVID-19 patients, taking into account the share of hospitalized patients requiring ventilator support, and the 20 percent increase in Medicare payments for COVID-19 patients; the share of COVID-19 patients requiring post-acute SNF or home health care, and the intensity of services they receive; the cost of medications used to manage patients outside the hospital setting; the cost of a vaccine, when it becomes available; and the number of beneficiaries who are tested for the coronavirus.",
            "However, just like in private insurance and Medicaid coverage, increases in Medicare spending may be partially offset by delayed or forgone procedures and office visits. A reduction in spending due to postponement of such procedures would offset the increase in Medicare spending for COVID-19 patients, at least in the short term. It is not yet known what share of these procedures will be rescheduled for later this year or shifted into 2021, or whether the delay in care will lead to costly adverse health events down the road.",
            "It is also not known the degree to which expanded telehealth services will impact Medicare spending. Prior to the outbreak, Medicare payments for telehealth were extremely limited under the traditional Medicare program. Based on new waiver authority included in theCoronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act(and as amended by theCARES Act) the HHS Secretary haswaived certain restrictions on Medicare coverage of telehealth servicesfor traditional Medicare beneficiaries during thecoronavirus public health emergency. This change could offset a decline in the number of in-person office visits and the associated Medicare spending that would otherwise occur.",
            "Capitated payments by the federal government to Medicare Advantage plans, which currently provide coverage to more than one third of the total Medicare population, may not be materially affected by the coronavirus in 2020 (though the underlying costs to those plans certainly could). Beginning in 2021, Medicare payments to Medicare Advantage plans could rise faster than expected based on the experience of plans this year and expectations for expenditures next year, or if benchmarks rise due to higher traditional Medicare spending; if average spending for traditional Medicare beneficiaries rises due to COVID-19, then payments would be likely to rise for Medicare Advantage plans, as well, with considerably variation across counties, across the country.",
            "For Medicare beneficiaries, the impact of COVID-19 on out-of-pocket spending in the short term will depend on whether they are infected and whether they require hospitalization for treatment. Although beneficiaries will face no out-of-pocket costs for testing or testing-related services, many would face exposure to costs for treatment, unless they have supplemental coverage that will pay some or all of these costs, or are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan that is waiving cost sharing for treatment. For patients who do not have COVID-19, they may face a drop in spending if they delay health care services they might otherwise have received, such as elective procedures or office visits. Over the longer term, beneficiaries could face an increase in out-of-pocket costs for Medicare premiums and deductibles if Medicare spending for 2020 increases due to COVID-19 (beyond what it otherwise would have).",
            "Medicaid program costs are expected to increase as a result of dealing with COVID-19 because of the cost of treating currently enrolled patients with COVID-19 and because overall enrollment is expected to rise as unemployment increases and people lose their job-based coverage.",
            "As a countercyclical program, Medicaid enrollment increases during economic downturns when people lose jobs and income and qualify for coverage. Increased demand and enrollment results in increased spending. As a condition to access a temporary increase in the Medicaid match rate, states must comply with maintenance of eligibility requirements and cannot restrict eligibility or make it more difficult to apply for Medicaid and states must also provide continuous eligibility through the emergency period. Increased enrollment and potentially higher costs tied testing and treatment of COVID-19 will put upward pressure on Medicaid costs.",
            "Even aside from enrollment increases, COVID-19 could result in higher costs to Medicaid programs than anticipated, as in private insurance and Medicare. Most Medicaid enrollees are served through capitated managed care plans, so new unanticipated costs could be incurred by private insurers. States could have options to negotiate rate adjustments, provide additional “kick” payments for COVID-19 related costs, implement carve-outs of COVID-19 related care, establish risk corridors or make retroactive adjustments to address higher than anticipated costs. Recent CMS guidance speaks specifically about such adjustments for COVID-19 testing and for the telehealth services.",
            "Similar to other payers, Medicaid programs may see some declines in utilization of non-urgent care; however, unlike other payers, a larger share of Medicaid spending may continue. The majority of Medicaid spending is for the low-income elderly and people with disabilities, which includes spending for long-term services and supports. These services provided in institutional or community based settings are ongoing and necessary to assist with activities of daily living and cannot be easily deferred.",
            "Strategies typically employed to reduce costs in response to economic conditions may not be viable. In past recessions, states have tried to manage costs by freezing or cutting provider rates or implementing targeted benefit restrictions. However, as many providers are strained by the coronavirus response, provider rate cuts may not be feasible and targeted benefit cuts are unlikely to amount to significant reductions in spending (especially because spending on some optional services, like dental care, are generally small and may be naturally lower if individuals are not accessing those services due to the pandemic).",
            "Medicaid may also be used as a vehicle to support providers as a result of COVID-19. An array of options may be available to help provide funding quickly to providers through Medicaid. For example, states can make advance, interim payments to providers based on historic claims. States can also pay higher rates for home and community based services during the emergency.",
            "The costs of coronavirus testing and COVID-19 treatment are expected to be high, reaching tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars, but there is extreme variation in estimates due to remaining uncertainty about the extent of the outbreak. Additionally, other care, such as for elective procedures and some outpatient care or pharmacy use, is likely to be forgone as hospitals take measures to free up capacity for COVID-19 patients and individuals put off care due to less access under social distancing orders or concerns over contracting the virus. On net, health spending could be higher this year and next than otherwise expected before the pandemic hit, but it is yet to be seen how upward and downward cost pressures will balance out.",
            "Private insurer earnings calls and quarterly cost data will provide some clues into how net spending has changed, but insurers will soon need to make decisions about participation and premiums for 2021 with very limited information. The implications of inaccurate assumptions could include higher premiums, steep increases in future years, and insurers exiting the market.",
            "Federal Medicare spending could increase more than it otherwise would due to COVID-19, but the magnitude of that increase is an open question. As is the case with private insurance, the increase in spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations over a period of several months in 2020 will be partially offset by the decrease in spending for non-urgent surgeries, procedures and other medical services. COVID-19 could lead to an increase in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2021, depending on the experience of plans in 2020, and whether higher spending on COVID-19 treatment is offset by reduced spending on non-urgent procedures. An increase in Medicare spending would have spillover effects for beneficiaries’ premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing, and come at a time when Medicare already faces long-term financing challenges.",
            "Medicaid programs will experience increased spending from both the treatment of COVID-19 and increased enrollment as unemployment increases and people lose their job-based coverage. Some of the cost-cutting mechanisms Medicaid programs employed under past recessions may not be an option in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.",
            "We analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2018 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65, as people over the age of 65 are typically on Medicare. This analysis used claims for almost 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market in 2018. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",
            "Admissions were classified as pneumonia when the associated diagnosis-related group (DRG) was 193, “Simple Pneumonia and Pleurisy with major complications,” 194 with “complication or comorbidity” or 195 “without complication.” Admissions were classified as a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support required for 96 hours or more when the associated DRG was 207, and a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support required for less than 96 hours when the associated DRG was 208. Total cost was trimmed for admissions below the 1st percentile and above the 99.5th percentile within DRG.",
            "We defined the type of admissions based on the classifications provided in the Marketscan database, similar to the approach used here, which classifies admissions into five categories: surgical; medical; childbirth and newborn; psychological and substance abuse; and, other. We defined an emergency admission as an admission that included at least one claim in the emergency room (as defined by “stdplac”).",

            "Employer-based health insurance is the largest source of health coverage for the nonelderly, covering 58% of this population in 2018. The workplace has long been a significant source of coverage for those in working families, although its importance has been declining over the long-term, particularly for those in lower and moderate-income households. As the economic consequences of COVID-19 continue to play out, many households may lose access to employer sponsored coverage. Recent data from theBureau of Labor Statisticsindicates a record number of jobless claims, suggesting a marked increase in unemployment over the next couple of months and potentially longer. This brief presents data from the most recent National Health Interview Survey to examine long-term trends in employer-based coverage and offer rates over the last two decades. It also examines the types of households which may be vulnerable as employer coverage continues to change and the economy responds to the pandemic.",
            "The share of the nonelderly population with employer-sponsored health insurance fell by more than 8 percentage points between 1998 and 2018, from 67% to 58%. The share of people with job-based coverage rose modestly over the five-year period between 2013 and 2018 as the economy improved, but not by nearly enough to offset the long-term decline. As unemployment rises due to the public health crisis, the modest gains in employer coverage in recent years are likely to be short-lived.",
            "In total, 156.5 million nonelderly people were enrolled in an employer plan in 2018. If coverage rates had stayed at the 1998 level (67%), around 23.3 million additional people would have been covered by employer-sponsored plans in 2018. Even among nonelderly people who are working, the percent covered by an employer plan has decreased from 75% in 1998 to 70% in 2018.",
            "The number of nonelderly people with employer-based insurance has fluctuated within a relatively narrow band over time, even as the nonelderly population grew by 34.2 million people. The number of people covered by employer-sponsored plans fell during the economic slowdown after 2008, and recovered after 2014, reaching about the same number as 1998. In total, about 156.5 million people were covered by an employer in 2018, compared to 156.1 million in 1998.",
            "The share of nonelderly people covered by an employer plan varies significantly with household income; Eleven percent of nonelderly people with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level were covered through a job in 2018, compared to 85% with incomes over 400% of the poverty level. Even among full-time workers, nonelderly people with lower incomes were much less likely to be covered by employer-sponsored coverage in 2018 than those with higher incomes. A quarter (24%) of full time workers below the poverty line were covered by an employer plan compared to 48% of those between 100 and 250 percent of poverty.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health Spending",
            "While the share of nonelderly people covered by employer plans has been decreasing, the trend is not uniform across income groups. The percentage of people with incomes above 400% of poverty who are covered by an employer plan is similar to 1998. The overall decrease in the coverage rate is explained by decreases in the coverage rates for those with lower household incomes. For example, individuals with household incomes between 100 and 250% of poverty saw a 19 percentage point decrease in coverage over the period.",
            "About 7.3 million more nonelderly people were in employer-sponsored plans in 2018 than 2013, but this in itself does not explain the 2 percentage point increase in coverage (from 56% to 58%). This trend is explained by an increase in the share of the nonelderly population with incomes over 400% of poverty (35% in 2013 to 40% in 2018), as well as a corresponding increase in the share of this population that is enrolled in employer-based plans (83.8% in 2013 to 85.0% in 2018).",
            "In 2018, 68% of workers were offered health benefits through their employer. During the period from 1998 to 2018, the percentage of workers offered employer-sponsored coverage dropped for workers in all household poverty categories. Although it has been increasing since 2013, overall the offer rate for nonelderly workers has decreased about 3 percentage points since 1998.",
            "The offer rate increased between 2013 and 2018 for workers with incomes below the Federal Poverty Level, which may be due to the employer requirement to offer coverage under the Affordable Care Act, although offer rates were largely flat over this period for other income groups.",
            "Not all workers are eligible for coverage, and not all of those who are eligible choose to enroll. Looking at nonelderly workers in households where someone is offered health benefits, we find that 84% of people are covered by an employer plan. The vast majority of employer’s who offer health insuranceextend the offer to a worker’s family,although covered workersmay face much higher premium contributions to enrolldependents. The rate at which these workers take-up an offer of coverage has decreased for income groups below 400% of poverty since 1998. Over that period, the largest decreases in take-up were among lower income households, with fewer workers in households below poverty or between 100% and 250% of poverty accepting an offer of coverage (down 14 and 13 percentage points respectively). One factor driving lower take-up rates may be theaffordability of employer plans for lower-income workers.",
            "Although the long-term trend is clearly and significantly downward, the coverage rate for employer-sponsored coverage rose modestly between 2013 and 2018. There are several factors that may explain these trends. One is that the economy improved steadily from the deep downturn in 2008 and 2009, with both incomes and employment increasing up until 2020. The number of people with full-time employment increased by over 12 million between2013and2018. The share of the nonelderly with incomes above 400% of poverty, where employer-sponsored health insurance is most prevalent, also rose during that period.",
            "However, these modest gains in recent years were not enough to offset the long-term decline in employer coverage, and they are likely to be reversed in the current economic and public health crises. Beyond decreasing the number of full-time workers, and therefore the number of workers with an employer offer, a more competitive job market may lead some employers to drop coverage or reduce the generosity of their offerings. Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), individuals losing employer coverage can remain enrolled on their employer plan for 18 months but are required to bear the full premium and an administrative fee. Given therelatively high cost of employercoverage, relatively few former workers tend to enroll in COBRA. Unlike the recession of 2008, additional coverage options such as subsidized non-group coverage and broader access to Medicaid in most states through the ACA, may affect how the uninsured rate and the share of employer coverage change in the current economic downturn.",
            "Taking a longer-term view, the increases over the last few years brought the number of people covered by employer-sponsored health insurance back to about the same number of people as in 1998, despite the nonelderly population growing by 34.2 million people over the period. As a result, the share of the population covered by job-based coverage has declined substantially. Coverage in employer-based plans, while still the largest single source of coverage among the nonelderly, has become less important overall and particularly among people with incomes below 400% of poverty. Prior to COVID-19, employer-based insurance was already a relatively uncommon source of coverage for lower income households, and that is likely to become even more true as economy responds to the pandemic.",
            "The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a national probability survey of American Households sponsored annually by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Although NHIS was started in 1957, the survey is redesigned periodically and had a major redesign in 1997. We used survey starting in 1998, which was the first year after the redesign that included all of the insurance categories we typically use (in 1998, the survey asks about coverage through Children’s Health Insurance Program and also includes the variable “NOTCOV” for individuals without coverage). For more information on NHIS, please seehttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis.htm.",
            "The analysis focuses on people below the age of 65 covered by employer-sponsored insurance (ESI). Some individuals have multiple types of coverage; individuals who are covered by Medicaid or Medicare Part B in addition to an employer plan are not included. Individuals who are covered by Medicare Part A and an employer plan are assumed to have ESI as their primary coverage (less than 1% in 2018). Full-time workers work at least 30 hours a week.",
            "Households at more than 400% the FPL earn different incomes depending on a family’s composition; for example, in 2018, a single nonelderly adult would earn about $52,000 and a family of four including two children would earn about $102,000.[i]",
            "[i]NHIS uses the Census Bureau’s federal poverty thresholds, while HHS and this portion of the brief usefederal poverty guidelinesto determine eligibility for some public assistance programs.",

Looking specifically at the hospital setting, the U.S. has more hospital-based employees per capita than most other comparable countries, but nearly half of these hospital workers are non-clinical staff. Overall, the U.S. has fewer hospitals and hospital beds per capita compared to other similar countries.",
            "The burden of disease due to medical conditions that put people at increased risk of severe complications from COVID-19 is higher in the U.S. than in comparable countries. Additionally, patients in the U.S. are more likely to face higher out-of-pocket costs and to be uninsured than in other comparable countries.",

Healthcare workers have a high risk of contracting COVID-19 given their constant exposure to people infected with the virus. The healthcare system can become further strained when medical providers and staff contract the virus – not only adding to the patient load but also reducing provider capacity to care for patients.",
            "The U.S. has fewer practicing physicians per capita (2.6 per 1,000 people) than most other similarly large and wealthy countries. The U.S. also has fewer physicians per 1,000 people than Italy (4.0) and Spain (3.9), both of which have already seen their workforce overwhelmed by the COVID-19 crisis.

Nearly 1 in 10 Americans (9.4%) were uninsured in 2018. Among comparably wealthy countries and Italy, South Korea, and Spain, the U.S. is the only country that does not provide universal or nearly universal health coverage. Because health insurance is often tied to employment in the U.S., it is possible the uninsured rate will rise as more workers become unemployed.",
            "On average, Americans incurred $1,125 in out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare in 2018, higher than the average in countries that have been severely impacted by COVID-19 or are similarly wealthy, with the exception of Switzerland. Arecent KFF analysisestimated that out-of-pocket expenses for COVID-19 hospitalization could exceed $1,300 for individuals with employer-based insurance, which is typically more generous than insurance obtained through the individual or small group market.",
            "According to the results from a 2016 international survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund, adults in the U.S. were more likely to report cost-related barriers to care. The results of the survey, as well as U.S. national survey data, indicate that adultsin worse healthdelay medical care because of costs more often than their healthier counterparts. Cost-related barriers to accessing care for people with underlying health conditions could exacerbate the severity of the outbreak within the U.S., since certain underlying conditions are associated with more severe COVID-19 outcomes.",

            "Population age distribution may factor into the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak from one country to another. In the U.S., 16.0% of the population is 65 and older. This share is higher in other comparably large and wealthy countries. The share of people who are 65 and older is 22.7% in Italy, 19.3% in Spain, 14.3% in South Korea, and 11.2% in China.",
            "The probability that an individual between the ages of 30 and 70 dies from cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, or cancer is higher in the U.S. (14.6%) than comparably large and wealthy countries. Individuals with severe, chronic medical conditions such as heart disease, respiratory diseases, and weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for more severe COVID-19 symptoms.",
            "Disease burdenis measured in “disability adjusted life years” (DALYs), which account for both the length and quality of life. Certain countries dealing with severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have relatively high rates of disease burden attributable to some chronic illnesses.",
            "Compared to similarly wealthy and other affected countries, the U.S. has relatively high rates of DALYs attributable to some of the health conditions that put people at high risk of severe COVID-19: cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes.",
            "In countries where disease burden for high-risk conditions is high, more people may be at risk of severe complications from COVID-19. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are currently unknown, but disease burden may increase in all countries as more people contract and recover from the virus.",

            "As the new coronavirus spreads within the United States, questions have arisen over the potential costs people may face if they become severely ill and need treatment. To address concerns over costs associated with COVID-19, Vice President Pencemetwith a group of large private insurers, who agreed to waive copayments and deductibles for COVID-19 tests. However, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP)clarifiedthat the out-of-pocket costs for treatment – such as hospitalizations for more serious cases – wouldnotbe waived, meaning people with private insurance who face deductibles could be on the hook for large costs.",
            "In this brief, we examine the potential cost to employer health plans and their enrollees of COVID-19 treatment by looking at typical spending for hospital admissions for pneumonia. We use a sample of the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters claims database, which includes claims from 18 million people enrolled in large employer plans in 2018. Specifically, we look at the costs of admissions for people with pneumonia, including three diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) for pneumonia without complications or comorbidity, with complications or comorbidity, and with major complications or comorbidity. These DRGs include pneumonia caused by similar (SARS-associated) coronavirus, as well as other viruses and bacteria. We also looked at two DRGs for respiratory system diagnoses requiring ventilator support. DRGs are groups of similar diagnoses for which the same level of hospital resources are generally required. (It is important to note that at this time, there are no curative treatments for the new coronavirus infection itself; rather, treatment addresses the complications from COVID-19-related illnesses). Our sample is limited to people under age 65.",
            "Beginning with the total cost of treatment, paid for by a combination of the employer plan and the employee’s out-of-pocket costs, we find that the average cost of an admission for pneumonia with major complications and comorbidities is $20,292 in 2018. However, costs vary greatly across the country, with admissions for pneumonia with major complications or comorbidities ranging from $11,533 (25thpercentile) to $24,178 (75thpercentile).",
            "Those without major complications could see lower total costs for a pneumonia admission, averaging $13,767 for people with less serious complications or comorbidities and $9,763 for those without any complications or comorbidities.",
            "The average hospital stay for admissions for pneumonia with or without complications or comorbidities is 3.2 days. Patients admitted for respiratory conditions which require a ventilator are often much longer; patients who receive 96 hours of ventilator support or more are admitted for 22.6 days on average and those with less than 96 hours of ventilator support spend 5.8 days in the hospital on average",
            "Health Spending",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "Reports from China indicate the average length of stay for a patient diagnosed with coronavirus was around11to12days. However, it is important to keep in mind that length of hospital stays vary between countries even under normal circumstances, so this may not be translatable to the U.S. In onestudyfrom China, about 2.3% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation.",
            "There is also considerable variation in the cost of admissions for respiratory conditions. For patients who require ventilator support, the combination of longer stays and higher intensity treatments results in higher average spending. The median total cost of an admission for a respiratory condition requiring 96 hours or more of ventilation is $88,114 dollars, compared to $34,225 for an admission requiring less than 96 hours of ventilation.",
            "Hospital costs, such as facility fees, represent about 90% of the cost of inpatient admissions for large group enrollees treated for pneumonia or those in need of ventilation due to respiratory illness. For those requiring ventilation, the remaining physician fees average over $3,000 for an admission with less than 96 hours of ventilation and over $9,000 dollar when the patient requires more than 96 hours of ventilation.",
            "The charts above show the total costs for admissions, including both the amount paid by insurance and the amount paid out-of-pocket. People with employer and other private coverage often face a deductible for hospital stays, which is the amount patients must pay before their insurance begins covering the cost of certain services. Across people with employer-sponsored coverage,82%of covered workers had a deductible, with55%having a deductible of over $1,000. On average, across people with and without deductibles, the typical deductible in employer sponsored plans is$1,396. Aside from deductibles, plans may charge other forms of cost-sharing for hospitalizations, such as copays (fixed dollar amounts) and coinsurance (a percent of the allowed charges) as well. The chart below examines total out-of-pocket costs, including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.",
            "We find that for pneumonia admissions without complications, out-of-pocket costs average $1,464. Out-of-pocket costs are similar, though a bit lower for people with major complications.  Average out-of-pocket costs for pneumonia admissions are similar regardless of severity because many people with hospitalizations reach their deductible and/or out-of-pocket max, thus limiting their exposure to the underlying cost. (People with comorbidities may have slightly lower out-of-pocket exposure because they may have incurred earlier health care costs that contributed toward them meeting their deductible).",
            "There are several reasons to believe out-of-pocket costs could be even higher during this outbreak than this analysis indicates:",
            "First, many patients will have higher deductibles, so their out-of-pocket exposure is largely a function of their plan design. The 75thpercentile for out-of-pocket costs for pneumonia (regardless of severity) was just over $2,000 in 2018. This analysis is based on claims from large employer plans, which tend to be the most generous private plans. People with private coverage throughsmall businessesand theindividual markettend to face higher deductibles.",
            "Second, the pandemic is emerging early in the calendar year, meaning that many people have not yet accrued much health spending to satisfy their deductibles. Deductible and out-of-pocket spending is concentrated early in the year, particularly January through March. On average, employee out-of-pocket spending does not reach the typical employer plan deductible untilmid-to-late May. In a normal year, many enrollees never meet their deductible, though it is possible more people will if the coronavirus pandemic leads to greater numbers of hospitalizations.",
            "Third, these figures do not include balance billing, which is when an out-of-network provider sends an additional bill directly to the patient for an amount not covered by the health plan. Patients often receive thesesurprise medical billsfor care, even when they go to in-network hospitals. Some large health insurance companies haveassured the publicthey will not charge higher cost-sharing for people who inadvertently go out-of-network, but only health care providers (such as hospital and physician groups) would be in a position to halt balance bills. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress had considered bipartisan legislation to address surprise billing, but had been met by resistance from both health care providers and insurers (more background ishere).",
            "Given concerns of surprise billing for COVID-19 treatment, we examined the incidence of out-of-network charges for in-network admissions related to pneumonia.",
            "We estimated that nearly 1 in 5 (18%) of patients who have in-network admissions for pneumonia with major complications or comorbidities face out-of-network charges. Fifteen percent of patients admitted into an in-network facility for all other medical conditions received an out-of-network charge. (This analysis builds on earlier analysis demonstrating that the incidence ofsurprise bills vary by diagnosis and type of admission.)",
            "Medical costs are already a common concern in the U.S., particularly for people without insurance, those with high deductibles, and those in worse health. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of even greater concern, as many people could be incurring high out-of-pocket costs, at a time when there is also risk of a recession. The pandemic could add more costs to the healthcare system, employers, and insurers as well, though that will depend on how many people are infected and how many become seriously ill. For individuals with private insurance who do become seriously ill, it is likely their out-of-pocket costs could top $1,300.",
            "The challenge of addressing these concerns over costs in the United States is exacerbated by a fragmented health insurance system and decentralized regulation process. Several states have moved to require fully-insured health plans regulated by the state to waive cost-sharing for testing. These states, however, are unable to regulate the self-insured employer plans, which are regulated by the federal government and cover 59% of covered workers at private sector employers. To date the federal response has been to ask insurers to voluntarily waive costs of testing. Consequently, some insurers administering self-insured employer plans have responded by extending this policy to their self-funded business, while allowing employers to opt-out.",
            "Even if testing is made widely available without cost-sharing, people with private coverage who contract COVID-19 risk high out-of-pocket costs if they need hospitalization. Former Vice President Joe Biden’s proposed response to COVID-19 would cover treatment costs through an emergency medical plan. At this time, the U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation to respond to COVID-19, but there is no indication that it will address treatment costs.",
            "We analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2018 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65, as people over the age of 65 are typically on Medicare. This analysis used claims for almost 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market in 2018. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",
            "Admissions were classified as pneumonia when the associated diagnosis-related group (DRG) was 193, “Simple Pneumonia and Pleurisy with major complications,” 194 with “complication or comorbidity” or 195 “without complication.” Admissions were classified as a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support required for 96 hours or more when the associated DRG was 207, and a respiratory system diagnosis with ventilator support required for less than 96 hours when the associated DRG was 208. Total cost was trimmed for admissions below the 1st percentile and above the 99.5th percentile within DRG.",
            "Inpatient claims were aggregated by admission. Each claim has a variable (‘ntwkprov’) that indicates whether or not the provider or facility providing the service was in the health plan’s network. In-network admissions were defined as admissions that included an in-network room and board charges. Some in-network admissions may include out-of-network facility charges.",

            "Telemedicine – the delivery of health services by providers at remote locations, such as through video conferencing or remote monitoring – has been seen as a way to possibly improve access to care while lowering costs. There is also potential for telemedicine, often referred to as telehealth, to expand access to care for people in rural areas or other places with limited provider availably. While utilization of telemedicine remains low, employers are increasingly likely to cover these services andexpress continued interestin refining their approach.",
            "In this brief, we combine data from our employer survey with employer claims data to examine the offering and uptake of telemedicine services by large group enrollees. We analyzed a sample of health benefit claims from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database to calculate the number of outpatient telemedicine appointments among people with large employer coverage. Physician office visits conducted over the telephone or online are only captured as a telemedicine appointment if the physician’s office documents this in the billing code, or in the location of the service (see methods).",
            "In our2019 Employer Health Benefit Survey(EHBS), we see that the vast majority of large employers offering health benefits cover telemedicine; over time the share of firms has increased from 27% in 2015, to 63% in 2017, to82% in 2019. The largest employers – those with 5,000 or more workers — are the most likely to cover telemedicine (90%), while smaller firms – those with 50 to 199 workers – are least likely (65%). Across all firms with at least 50 workers, 69% say their largest plan covers telemedicine.",
            "Some employers not only cover telemedicine, but also provide a financial incentive to encourage enrollees to use telemedicine instead of visiting a brick and mortar facility. Among large employers offering telemedicine services in their largest plans, 53% have an incentive, such as lower cost sharing to encourage employees to use these services.",
            "While the vast majority of large group enrollees receive coverage for telemedicine visits, there has been relatively slow adoption by enrollees.",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Access & Affordability",
            "In 2018, 2.4% of large group enrollees who had an outpatient office visit had at least one telemedicine visit.  While still relatively few enrollees see a telemedicine provider, these services are becoming more common, increasing from 1.6% in 2017.",
            "Telemedicine has the potential to improve access to care, particularly in rural areas where people may have to travel long distances to see a physician. However, we find the take-up rate of telemedicine is similarly low among both urban and rural enrollees in large employer coverage. In 2018, 2.1% of rural enrollees with at least 6 months of coverage and at least one outpatient claim used telemedicine, compared to 2.4% of urban enrollees.",
            "Telemedicine usage was relatively similar among all age groups. While 2.6% of young adults (18-34 year-olds) with an outpatient claim used at least one telemedicine service during the year, 3.3% of 35-44 year-olds and 2.7% of 45-54 year-olds did as well.",
            "Employers are increasingly likely to cover telemedicine services, yet while take-up is growing overall use remains low. While just over 2% of large group enrollees with an outpatient visit had a telehealth claim, an even smaller percentage of the total number of visits took places from a provider at a remote location. Because the most recent MarketScan data only extends through 2018, it is yet to be seen whether use of telemedicine has substantially increased over the past year as more employers have started covering these services.",
            "Telehealth can expand the options available to enrollees, including for services such asreproductive healthandmental health.  While the cost of delivering care through telemedicine is often less expensive than providing care in person, somestudieshave suggested that the ease of telemedicine may increase the overall use of healthcare services. Our findings mirror the experience of publicpayersthat have made an effort to expand coverage but for whom usage remains relativelylow. For telemedicine to be able to move the needle on access to care or overall health spending, more enrollees will need to utilize these services.",
            "We analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2018 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65. This analysis used claims for almost 18 million people representing about 22% of the 82 million people in the large group market in 2018. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age and state. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.  The sample was limited to people who had an outpatient visit and coverage for more than half of the year (13.1 million observations representing 60 million people).",
            "A telehealth visit is one with a CPT code 99201 to 99205, or 99211 to 99215, or 90832 to 90834, or 90836 to 90839, or 99441 to 99444, or 98966 to 98969, or 99495 to 99496 and either a procedure modifier (procmod) of GT or GQ or 95 or the location of the service was listed as telehealth (stplac equal to 2). In addition, HCPCS codes Q3014 and T1014 were listed as telehealth visits, and any HCHPS code with modifiers procedure modifiers GT or GQ or 95 or the places of service was listed as telehealth. This list is not exhaustive, some telehealth visits happen between providers, as well as some forms of remote monitoring, and inpatient telehealth visits are not included, seeMultilayered Analysis of Telehealth: How This Emerging Venue of Care Is Affecting the Healthcare Landscapefor an analysis of these types of visits. Please note, we revised the definition of telehealth, from our brief published in October 2018, to utilize the stplac variable which has been added to the Marketscan file.",

            "The term “surprise medical bill” describes charges arising when an insured person inadvertently receives care from an out-of-network provider. Surprise medical bills can arise in an emergency when the patient has no ability to select the emergency room, treating physicians, or ambulance providers. Surprise bills can also arise when a patient receives planned care. For example, a patient could go to an in-network facility (e.g., a hospital or ambulatory surgery center), but later find out that a provider treating her (e.g., an anesthesiologist or radiologist) does not participate in her health plan’s network. In either situation, the patient is not in a position to choose the provider or to determine that provider’s insurance network status.",
            "In this analysis, we use claims data from large employer plans to estimate the incidence of out-of-network charges associated with hospital stays and emergency visits that could result in a surprise bill. We find that millions of emergency visits and hospital stays put people with large employer coverage at risk of receiving a surprise bill. For people in large employer plans, 18% of all emergency visits and 16% of in-network hospital stays had at least one out-of-network charge associated with the care in 2017. We also examine state and federal policies aimed at addressing the incidence of surprise billing. Our analysis finds a high degree of variation by state in the incidence of potential surprise billing for people with large employer coverage, who are generally not protected by state surprise billing laws if their plan is self-insured. For people with large employer coverage, emergency visits and in-network inpatient stays are both more likely to result in at least one out-of-network charge in Texas, New York, Florida, New Jersey, and Kansas, and less likely in Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Maine, and Mississippi.",
            "Surprise medical bills generally have two components. The first component is the higher amount the patient owes under her health plan, reflecting the difference in cost-sharing levels between in-network and out-of-network services. For example, a preferred provider health plan (PPO) might require a patient to pay 20% of allowed charges for in-network services and 40% of allowed charges for out-of-network services. In an HMO or other closed-network plan, the out-of-network service might not be covered at all.",
            "The second component of surprise medical bills is an additional amount the physician or other provider may bill the patient directly, a practice known as “balance billing.” Typically, health plans negotiate discounted charges with network providers and require them to accept the negotiated fee as payment-in-full. Network providers are prohibited from billing plan enrollees the difference (or balance) between the allowed charge and the full charge. Out-of-network providers, however, have no such contractual obligation. As a result, patients can be liable for the balance bill in addition to any applicable out-of-network cost sharing.",
            "Unexpected medical bills, including surprise medical bills, lead the list of expenses most Americans worry they would not be able to afford.Two-thirds of Americanssay they are either “very worried” (38 percent) or “somewhat worried” (29 percent) about being able to afford their own or a family member’s unexpected medical bills.",
            "See more briefs and data.",
            "Four in ten (39%) insured nonelderly adults said they received an unexpected medical bill in the past 12 months, including one in ten who say that bill was from an out-of-network provider. Of those who received an unexpected bill, half say the amount they were expected to pay was less than $500 overall while 13 percent say the unexpected costs were $2,000 or more.",
            "Eight in ten Americans(78%) support passage of federal legislation to protect patients from surprise medical bills.  A majority (57%) continue to support such legislation even after hearing opponents’ arguments that it could lead to doctors and hospitals being paid less.",
            "To estimate the incidence of potential surprise medical bills, we analyzed large employer claims data from IBM’s MarketScan Research Database, which contains information provided by large employers about claims and encounters for almost 19 million individuals. By using a claims database, we can examine situations that are likely to result in a surprise out-of-network bill. For example, these data can be used to estimate how often an enrollee accesses services through an emergency room and receives services that are billed as out-of-network. The data can also show when an enrollee had an inpatient admission at an in-network hospital or other facility and yet receives covered services that are billed as out-of-network. The database does not provide complete information about surprise bills, however. In particular, the database contains only paid claims, not denied claims, and so, with respect to in-network inpatient stays, it may not reflect claims for services provided by out-of-network providers if the group plan (say, an HMO), denied those out-of-network claims. In addition, the MarketScan database reflects only the amount of allowed charges under a plan. As a result, the database cannot provide estimates of the dollar amounts of surprise bills – the difference between billed charges and allowed charges – involved in surprise medical bills. For more information, see the Methods.",
            "In an emergency setting, patients are often unable to ensure they go to an in-network emergency room. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides partial protection for patients receiving out-of-network emergency care. The ACA requires all non-grandfathered health plans to cover out-of-network emergency services and to apply the in-network level of cost sharing to such services. Health plans are also required to pay a reasonable amount for the out-of-network emergency services.[i]However, the ACA does not prohibit balance billing by facilities or providers for emergency care. As a result, patients can and do receive surprise bills for emergency care from the emergency room facility and from providers who treat the patient in the ER. Surprise medical bills might also arise from the hospital and/or other treating providers if the emergency patient is subsequently admitted for inpatient care.[ii]",
            "Of the emergency room visits in 2017 by people with large employer coverage, we estimate 18% had at least one out-of-network charge (from either the facility, the provider, or both) associated with the visit. This includes out-of-network charges from the emergency facility, emergency room providers, and provider and facility charges associated with a resulting inpatient stay, when applicable.",
            "The rate of out-of-network billing in emergency settings for people with large employer coverage varies quite a bit from state to state. About a quarter or more of emergency visits in Texas (38%), New Mexico (29%), New York (28%), California (26%), Kansas (24%), and New Jersey (24%) resulted in at least one out-of-network charge in 2017, while the rate was under 5% in Minnesota (3%), South Dakota (4%), Nebraska (4%), and Alabama (4%). Emergency visits in urban areas (18%) are somewhat more likely to result in at least one out-of-network charge than are visits in rural areas (14%). The data used in this analysis are for large employers whotypically self-insureand are therefore not subject to current state protections.",
            "Most of the potential surprise out-of-network emergency charges observed in this study were from doctors and other out-of-network professionals, rather than from the hospital or emergency facility. Most people with large employer coverage use in-network emergency facilities. Nationally in 2017, 78% of emergency visits by people with large employer coverage were at an in-network facility.",
            "Emergency visits that lead to an inpatient admission are more likely to result in an out-of-network charge (26%) than outpatient-only emergency visits (17%). This is in part due to out-of-network charges that occur after admission, but also due to a higher likelihood of out-of-network emergency professional charges in these cases.",
            "Surprise medical bills also arise from inpatient admissions, generally when patients are admitted to an in-network hospital or other facility for care. Even within an in-network facility, out-of-network charges for professional services can occur. That is because the doctors who work in hospitals often do not workforthe hospitals; rather they bill patients separately and may not participate in the same health plan networks that cover the in-network facility.",
            "The ACA protections for emergency services, described above, do not apply to non-emergency services, including non-emergency surprise medical bills, so in non-emergency admissions, the patient not only is at risk of being balanced billed by the provider, but also faces higher cost sharing under her insurance plan for the out-of-network claims. If the patient’s health plan is a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or an Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO) that does not provide any coverage for non-emergency care received out of network, the surprise medical bill claim may not be covered by the health plan at all.",
            "In 2017, among people with large employer coverage who had inpatient stays, the vast majority (90%) were at in-network facilities. Even when patients were admitted to in-network facilities, though, 16% of these stays resulted in at least one out-of-network charge for a professional service. As described above, in many of these cases, the patient not only is at risk of being balanced billed by the provider, but also likely faces higher out-of-pocket costs under her insurance plan for the out-of-network claims.",
            "The rate of out-of-network charges for services at in-network inpatient facilities ranged from 2% of in-network inpatient stays in South Dakota, Nebraska, and Minnesota, to about a quarter or more in New York (33%), New Jersey (29%), Texas (27%), and Florida (24%). Inpatient stays in urban areas (16%) are somewhat more likely to result in at least one out-of-network charge than are stays in rural areas (11%).",
            "States have begun to enact laws to protect some patients from surprise medical bills, though, as discussed below, these state laws generally do not apply to people with large employer coverage whose employers self-insure. At leastnine stateshave enacted and implemented laws taking a comprehensive approach to surprise bills (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon). Four more states –New Mexico,Washington,Colorado, andTexasenacted new surprise medical bill laws in 2019 that have not yet taken effect.[iii]",
            "The comprehensive state laws share common features:",
            "Comprehensive state laws hold consumers harmless against surprise medical bills. The hold-harmless protection generally involves two types of requirements – one for state-regulated health insurers, and one for providers. Insurers are required to cover out-of-network claims and apply in-network level of cost sharing for surprise medical bills. In addition, laws prohibit providers from balance billing patients covered by state-regulated plans; instead, the out-of-network provider is limited to collect no more than the applicable in-network cost-sharing amount from patients in cases of surprise medical bills.",
            "State laws may also require notice to consumers about their rights and protections. New York, for example, requires state-regulated insurers to include prominent, standardized notice on the explanation-of-benefits (EOB) statement summarizing consumer rights regarding surprise medical bills. Notices also give consumers information about where they can file complaints or receive help. In California and New Mexico, out-of-network providers also are required to include prominent notice in billing invoices and other written communications pertaining to surprise medical bills that the consumer is not liable to pay more than the in-network cost sharing amount.",
            "After indemnifying the patients, comprehensive state laws then provide for resolution of the payment amount for surprise medical bills. Approaches vary, with some states adopting a payment standard for all applicable surprise medical bills, while other states establish a dispute resolution process that insurers and providers can use to arrive at a payment amount for each surprise medical bill. States sometimes use a combination of both approaches.",
            "California’s surprise medical bill law, for example, requires state-licensed managed care plans to pay out-of-network providers the greater of 125% of the amount Medicare fee-for-service would pay, or the average contracted amount the managed care plan pays for the same/similar service in that geographic region.",
            "New York’s law uses a binding arbitration process to resolve payment disputes. The formal process is used infrequently, however, because the law incentivizes insurers and providers to reach agreement on their own. Under the New York system, the insurer and provider first negotiate to settle the surprise medical bill. If they can’t agree, an arbitration process can be invoked; each party submits its best offer and the arbiter decides which offer wins. The losing party must pay the cost of arbitration, which typically can be $300 to $500. This so-called “baseball style arbitration” process incentivizes both plans and providers to try to resolve surprise bills informally, if at all possible. State regulators indicate most surprise bills subject to the New York law are resolved informally; New York’s formal dispute resolution process was used for1,096 claimsin 2017.",
            "All states have limited jurisdiction to protect privately insured residents from surprise medical bills due to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. This federal law preempts state regulation of employer-provided health benefit plans. That means states are preempted from requiring employer plans to cover out-of-network surprise bills; they are also preempted from requiring these plans to apply in-network cost sharing to out-of-network surprise bills; and they are preempted from requiring these plans to settle payment disputes with out-of-network providers over surprise bills using state-established payment rules or procedures. Though ERISA allows states to regulate the group health insurance policies that some employers buy from insurance companies,61% of covered workers(and 81% of those in large firms) are covered under self-insured group health plans that are beyond the reach of state regulation. Our estimates of surprise medical bills under large group health plans largely reflect consumers whose plans would not be subject to state law.",
            "In addition, a number of states have enacted less comprehensive protections against surprise medical bills for the plans they regulate. Some states, for example, require only that consumers be notified by their health plan (or hospital) that they might encounter surprise medical bills, but do not impose other requirements on health plans or providers that would shield consumers from the cost of surprise medical bills. Some state laws protect consumers against surprise medical bills for emergency care, but do not apply to bills from out-of-network providers rendering care in in-network hospitals. Some state surprise bills laws apply to HMOs but not to other state-licensed insurers.",
            "Because ERISA preempts states’ abilities to regulate self-insured plans, federal action would be necessary to address certain aspects of surprise bills for people enrolled in these plans. On May 9, 2019,President Trumpcalled on Congress to enact bipartisan legislation to end surprise medical bills. The President called for a prohibition on balance billing for all emergency care and for services from out-of-network providers that patients did not choose themselves. He also said that surprise bill protections should apply to all types of health insurance, including group and non-group.",
            "Federal legislation to prevent surprise medical bills is moving in Congress with bipartisan and bi-cameral support. In July 2019, the House Energy and Commerce Committee approved by voice vote a bipartisan bill,H.R. 2328, with provisions to prevent surprise medical bills. That month, the Senate Health Education Labor and Pension (HELP) Committee also voted on a bipartisan basis to approveS. 1895with provisions to prevent surprise medical bills.",
            "In February 2020, two other House Committees announced they would mark up surprise medical bill legislation that also enjoys bipartisan support in each committee. In advance of the committee votes, the HouseWays and Means Committeeand the HouseEducation and Labor Committeeeach released discussion drafts of this legislation.",
            "All four bills are very similar in scope of covered surprise medical bills. All would apply to out-of-network emergency claims. All would also apply to post-stabilization inpatient services provided to patients who are admitted to the hospital from the emergency room. The HELP Committee and Education and Labor Committee bills would apply to air ambulance services. In addition, the Education and Labor Committee bill authorizes the Secretary to apply surprise bill protections for ground ambulance services after receiving recommendations from an advisory committee of experts and stakeholders relating to this benefit. Finally, all of the Committee bills would cover non-emergency services provided at in-network hospitals and other facilities by out-of-network physicians and other providers.",
            "All of the Committee bills also provide similar protections to consumers from surprise medical bills. Both would hold patients harmless by requiring health plans and insurers to cover the out-of-network surprise bill and apply the in-network level of cost sharing. Both measures would also prohibit out-of-network facilities and providers from balance billing on surprise medical bills. And both bills would apply to individual health insurance plans, as well as to group health plans, whether fully-insured or self-insured – thus reaching private plans that states are preempted from regulating.",
            "Still to be resolved, however, are differences in approaches to resolving payment for surprise medical bills.  The Committee bills take different approaches.",
            "Senate HELP Committee –The HELP Committee bill requires that the payment rate for out-of-network surprise medical bills will be the insurer’s median in-network payment rate for the same service in the same geographic area.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates federal budget savings of$24.9 billion over 10 yearsfrom this approach to determining payment rates for surprise bills.  One key assumption in the CBO estimate is that the default payment rate for out-of-network surprise bills will have the effect of limiting rates that insurers pay for in-network services.  Another key assumption is that the distribution of payment rates for surprise bills today is highly variable and skewed; setting a default payment at the median rate will have the effect of bringing down the highest in-network payment rates and generally causing payment rates for all surprise bill services to converge around the median rates.  Federal deficit savings would be generated if overall insurance costs decline; this could reduce the amount of federal subsidies for private insurance through the Marketplace, the tax subsidy for employer-provided health benefits, and the amount of the medical expense deduction taken by individuals on federal income tax returns.",
            "House Energy and Commerce Committee –The Energy and Commerce committee bill also requires a default payment rate for surprise medical bills equal to the insurer’s median in-network payment rate, and includes two additional material changes. First, the median in-network rate would be defined as the rate in 2019, indexed by inflation (CPI-U) in subsequent years.  Because medical care payment rates historically have risen faster than the inflation rate, CBO estimates this indexing provision would generate greater federal budget savings. Second, the Energy and Commerce bill requires establishment of an Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) process that providers or insurers could use if dissatisfied with the default payment and if the default payment rate is higher than $1,250. Each party would submit its payment offer to the IDR entity, which would choose the most appropriate offer. To reach this determination, the IDR entity could consider various factors – including the median in-network insurer charges, the severity of a case and the provider’s unique specialty training, but not the provider’s billed charge. Upon reaching a determination, the party whose offer was not selected would be required to pay a fee to cover the cost of IDR for that claim. CBO estimates overall savings would decline as a result of the IDR process, both due to its administrative costs and to the likelihood that payment for some surprise bills would increase above the median in-network payment rate as a result. Overall, CBO estimated the Energy and Commerce bill would yield$21.9 billion over 10 years.[iiii]",
            "HELP and Energy and Commerce Compromise –Since these two Committees voted on legislation last summer, their leaders continued discussion and, in December of 2019 tentatively announced agreement on acompromisewith respect to payment for surprise bills that both Committees could support. The compromise would follow the Energy and Commerce version, except a lower $750 threshold would apply for surprise bills to be eligible for the IDR process.",
            "House Education and Labor Committee –Recently, the House Education and Labor Committee, with primary jurisdiction over ERISA-governed group health plans, released their proposal for surprise medical bill protection. To resolve payment amounts for surprise bills, Education and Labor follows the HELP/Energy and Commerce compromise approach. Surprise bills initially would be paid at the health plan’s median in-network rate (which would be based on the 2019 median rate indexed annually by CPI-U). Out-of-network facilities and providers not satisfied with this amount could request review under an IDR process if the median in-network payment amount is $750 or more. The IDR entity could consider the same information (and would not be allowed to consider the provider’s undiscounted billed charge) and the losing party would pay the IDR fee. CBO estimates of the impact of this proposal were not available at this writing.",
            "House Ways and Means Committee –Finally, the House Ways and Means Committee outlined a somewhat different approach to resolving surprise medical bills. Ways and Means also would designate the plan’s median in-network rate as the amount that would be used to determine patient cost sharing for the surprise out-of-network bill. Like the Energy and Commerce bill, Ways and Means would constrain the median-in-network rate, basing it on the 2019 rate indexed annually by CPI-U. This median rate would be re-based every five years.",
            "The Ways and Means proposal does not require use of this benchmark rate to determine initial payment for the claim, however. Instead, Ways and Means would require negotiations between health plans and providers to reach an agreed-upon payment amount for each surprise bill. At the end of 30 days of negotiation, either party could request review under an IDR process. No claims dollar threshold amount would apply. The IDR process would otherwise generally follow rules as prescribed in the Energy and Commerce bill.  That is, the IDR entity would consider each party’s offer, taking into account the median in-network charge but not the provider’s billed charge. The IDR entity would then select one offer and the losing party would pay the IDR fee. CBO estimates of the impact of the Ways and Means proposal were not available at this writing.",
            "Importantly for the consumer, under all of the Committee bills, the amount of patient cost sharing for the surprise medical bill is determined up front, based on the health plan’s initial in-network payment rate for the service. That means if the out-of-network provider subsequently seeks and wins a higher payment amount through negotiations or the IDR process, the patient’s cost sharing for the surprise medical bill claim would not be increased.",
            "Roe-Ruiz bill –Notably, all four of these Committee bills are materially different from an altogether different approach to resolving payment for surprise medical bills outlined in yet another with bipartisan support, HR 3502, sponsored by Rep. Ruiz (D-CA) and Rep. Roe (R-TN). No default payment amount would be established for surprise medical bills under this measure.  Instead, insurers and providers would first engage in negotiations over the payment amount for each surprise medical bill. If no agreement is reached, the dispute would be taken to an IDR process that would take into account both the median-in-network payment rate and the 80thpercentile of actual billed charges.  Although no formal CBO estimate on this bill has yet been published, onenews reportindicates CBO would find it would cost “double digit billions” of dollars in increased federal spending over the next 10 years.",
            "Table 1 compares key provisions of the four Committee measures and HR 3502 and their resulting cost impact on the federal government.",
            "Finally, several of the committee measures include other provisions to protect consumers and promote transparency. All four Committee measures require health plans to periodically update their provider directories for accuracy. The Ways and Means Committee bill requires plans to follow continuity of care requirements, giving patients in-network level of temporary (up to 90 days) coverage for care when their in-network provider leaves the health plan network while treatment is ongoing.  The Ways and Means Committee bill also requires that ACA external appeal protections apply to enrollees who dispute the way their plan handled surprise medical bills. Under Obama Administrationregulationspublished in 2011, ACA external appeal rights under most plans only apply to claims denied or limited on the basis of medical necessity determinations and related clinical-judgement determinations.",
            "We find that millions of emergency visits and hospital stays left people with large employer coverage at risk of a surprise bill in 2017. Our analysis of large employer health plan claims finds that potential surprise medical bills are a common problem – affecting 18% of emergency care visits and 16% of in-network inpatient stays. The rate of these potential surprise bills varies from state-to-state, with Texas, New York, Florida, New Jersey, and Kansas having among the highest rates of out-of-network charges associated with both emergency care and in-network hospital stays among people with large employer coverage. Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Maine, and Mississippi, by contrast, had among the lowest rates of out-of-network charges for both emergency and in-network hospital care for people with large employer coverage. The incidence of surprise medical bills in small group or non-group health plans may be different and was beyond the scope of this study.",
            "By definition surprise bills are beyond the ability of consumers to anticipate or avoid; and surprise bills generate expenses that health insurance does not cover and that can be financially burdensome to patients. States have started taking action – establishing requirements for both the health plans and the providers they regulate in order to shield consumers from surprise medical bills. However, ERISA preemption means state laws cannot reach the vast majority of consumers with private coverage through employer-based plans. The high rates of surprise medical bills that we observe in California and New York, which have adopted comprehensive state statutes, demonstrate the limits of state regulation of surprise bills.",
            "National consensus on surprise medical bill protections seems to be emerging. There is strong bipartisan support among the public to address surprise bills. Members of Congress are working in a bipartisan manner to develop legislation and the President has urged enactment of a federal law to protect patients from surprise medical bills. The insurance industry, employer organizations, and hospital and physician groups have also urged measures to protect patients from surprise medical bills.",
            "However, how much providers should be paid for surprise medical bills remains a contentious issue that, unless resolved, could derail patient protections.",
            "In particular, health insurers and employer groups haverecommendeda federal payment standard as a less complex and costly approach to resolving millions of surprise medical bills each year.  On the other side, hospital and physician groups have urged reliance on negotiation or mediation to resolve surprise bills, and generally opposed use of a fixed payment standard. Theyarguea fixed payment standard might not be sufficient, might incentivize insurers to rely on default payments rather than contract with providers to join networks, and might lead to broader federal rate setting for provider payments. This summer, an organization called “Doctor Patient Unity,” backed by venture capital owners of physician group practices and freestanding emergency departments, invested millions of dollars in television ads opposing surprise billing legislation.",
            "Estimates from CBO illustrate that a surprise bill payment standard based on median in-network rates would, in fact, put downward pressure on provider payments. Conversely, a system based on mediation could increase payment rates. Since the federal government subsidizes private insurance through the ACA marketplace and in employer-based plans, this has significant implications for the federal budget as well.",
            "It remains to be seen whether disagreement over how to resolve payment amounts for surprise bills can be resolved, or if it will halt progress on legislation to protect consumers from these bills.",
            "We analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2017 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65. This analysis used claims for almost 19 million people representing about 22% of the 86 million people in the large group market in 2017. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of a thousand or more workers by sex, age, state and whether the enrollee was a policy holder or dependent. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range.",
            "The advantage of using claims information to look at out-of-pocket spending is that we can look beyond plan provisions and focus on actual payment liabilities incurred by enrollees. A limitation of these data is that they reflect cost sharing incurred under the benefit plan and do not include balance-billing payments that beneficiaries may make to health care providers for out-of-network services or out-of-pocket payments for non-covered services.",
            "Inpatient claims were aggregated by admission and outpatient claims were aggregated by the day (‘outpatient days’). Each claim on the inpatient and outpatient services files has a variable (‘ntwkprov’) that indicates whether or not the provider or facility providing the service was in the health plan’s network.",
            "We defined an emergency room visit as an outpatient day or admission that included at least one claim in the emergency room (as defined by “stdplac”). Some admissions may include an emergency room claim, and an out-of-network service that took place outside of the emergency room. In total, there were 15 million ER visits, six percent of which were associated with an inpatient admission.",
            "In-network admissions were defined as admissions that included an in-network room and board charges. Some in-network admissions may include out-of-network facility charges. In total, there were about 3.5 million in-network admissions. Data are not presented for states with fewer than 3,000 unweighted emergency room visits or 500 in-network admissions or where an insufficient number of data contributors submitted information.",
            "[i]Federal regulationsrequire health plans to pay the greater of 3 amounts for out-of-network emergency services (net of the applicable in-network cost sharing): (1) the amount negotiated with in-network providers for the emergency service; (2) the amount the plan typically pays for out-of-network services (such as the usual, customary, and reasonable charge); or (3) the amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency service.",
            "[ii]Section 2719A of the Public Health Service Act defines emergency services in the same way as the federal Emergency Medical treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). However, the application of EMTALA to patients admitted as inpatients from the emergency room has been disputed and litigated. Federal courts have taken different views as to a hospital’s “stabilization obligation” under EMTALA when it comes to inpatients. See, for example,https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20101228_RS22738_a6cc21b68c20d1982533d6249774e019179ef6a5.pdf",
            "[iii]See Jack Hoadley, Kevin Lucia, and Maanasa Kona, “State Efforts to Protect Consumers from Balance Billing” for summary of state laws enacted through 2018. In the 2019 legislative session,New Mexicoenacted a new law protecting residents from surprise medical bills, both for emergency and non-emergency services, under state-regulated health insurance. The law takes effect January 1, 2020. It requires state-regulated health plans to provide in-network level of coverage for surprise medical bills and prohibits providers form balance billing patients. The law also provides that surprise out-of-network bills will be paid at the 60thpercentile of the insurer’s allowed charge for the service performed by an in-network provider, but no less than 150% of the applicable 2017 Medicare payment rate. The state ofWashingtonalso enacted a surprise medical bill law in 2019. Similar to the New Mexico law, Washington requires state-regulated plans to cover surprise medical bills for both emergency and nonemergency services at the in-network level of cost sharing and prohibits providers from balance billing patients. The Washington law establishes a mediation process that health plans and providers must use to resolve the amount of each surprise medical bill if the plan and providers cannot successfully negotiate an amount on their own.Colorado’s new law also becomes effective January 1, 2020. It applies to emergency and non-emergency surprise bills, requiring state-regulated health plans to provide in-network level of coverage for such bills and prohibiting provider balance billing. The law establishes payment rate benchmarks for surprise bills, based on the health plan’s payment rate for comparable in-network providers or based on a measure of the in-network payment rates by all plans in the state’s all-payer-claims database. Out-of-network providers can appeal these payment rates to a mediation system in certain circumstances. Finally, a new law enacted inTexaswill apply to surprise medical bills beginning January 1, 2020. The Texas law requires state-regulated plans, including state employee and teacher plans, to cover surprise medical bills for both emergency and nonemergency services, including diagnostic lab and imaging services ordered by an in-network physician. Plans must cover out-of-network surprise bills with in-network level of cost sharing and providers are prohibited from balance billing patients. Texas requires plans to make an initial direct payment to the out-of-network provider for the surprise bill. The provider can then request an independent dispute resolution process. For hospitals and other facilities, this is a mandatory mediation process that the facility and insurer must use to resolve the amount of the surprise bill. If agreement cannot be reached, either party can bring a civil action in court. For other providers, Texas will make a mandatory arbitration process available. The arbitrator will make a binding determination of the payment amount for the surprise bill. A mandatory informal settlement conference is required before either mediation or arbitration begins. Under both processes, the fees for mediation or arbitration must be split evenly between the health plan and the facility/provider.",
            "[iiii]The other bi-partisan Senate bill,S 1531, is similar to the Energy and Commerce Committee bill in terms of the scope of covered surprise bills and the hold harmless patient protections it would require. To resolve payment for surprise bills, S. 1531 would establish a default payment rate for surprise bills equal to the insurer’s median in-network payment rate, but would not index that payment rate to inflation. S. 1531 also would establish a similar IDR process that would take into account the median in-network payment and other factors, but not the provider’s billed charge. S 1531 does not set a claims threshold to limit eligibility of surprise bills for the IDR process. Under both S 1531 and the House Energy and Commerce reported bill – and similar to New York State’s IDR process for resolving surprise bills, the losing party would pay the cost of the IDR process. CBO has not published a cost estimate for S 1531.",

            "There has been considerable attention to the issue of “surprise-medical bills,” or the occurrence of out-of-network charges when a patient was unaware of charges and therefore could not reasonably avoid them. Earlier this year, we estimated that 18% of emergency visits and 16% of inpatient admissions at in-network hospitals resulted in at least one out-of-network bill. Out-of-network charges typically leave patients exposed to higher costs, both through plan cost-sharing requirements as well as “balance billing” from the provider. Balance billing is a practice in which out-of-network providers – who have not negotiated discounted rates with an insurer – charge patients the difference between what they received from the insurer and their full charge for a service. For an in-depth explanation of out-of-network billing, consumer protections and current legislative proposals, see our earlier brief:An examination of surprise medical bills and proposals to protect consumers from them.",
            "This analysis looks at the prevalence of potential surprise medical bills based on patient diagnosis, emergency visits, and type of inpatient admission. We find that these factors can also affect the likelihood that patients may incur surprise out-of-network bills.  As in our earlier brief, we analyzed insurance claims from large employer plans to identify how often inpatient admissions, emergency room visits or outpatient surgeries result in a claim from an out-of-network provider.",
            "Overall, 16% of admissions at an in-network hospital lead to at least one out-of-network charge.  Compared to all admissions, admissions for surgery are more likely to lead to an out-of-network charge (21%). One in five in-network admissions for mental health and/or substance abuse (20%) also lead to out-of-network charges, while admissions for childbirth and newborn care are less likely to include a claim from an out-of-network provider (10%).",
            "We examined the incidence of out-of-network charges among people covered by large employer health plans who received emergency services or inpatient stays at in-network facilities for a heart attack. The incidence of out-of-network charges was 50% higher for heart attacks compared to the incidence rate of all diagnoses for both emergency services (27% vs. 18%) and for inpatient admission at in-network facilities (23% vs. 16%), respectively.",
            "We also examined the incidence of out-of-network charges among patients having breast cancer surgery. Our method of identifying potential surprise medical bills generally counts out-of-network charges incurred on the same day as a patient’s emergency room visit and charges incurred during the same days that a patient was treated at in-network inpatient facility. This method, however, may not capture all of the surprise bills that certain patients may face. In particular, patients undergoing a mastectomy or lumpectomy — procedures typically performed on an outpatient basis to treat breast cancer — also receive surgical pathology services to diagnose and stage the cancer and determine appropriate treatment. These surgical pathology services may be provided on the same day or on a different day than the breast cancer surgery.",
            "See more briefs and data.",
            "To account for the break in time between the date of surgery and when the surgical pathology is performed, we analyzed claims of women covered by large employer plans who had a mastectomy at in-network facilities (either inpatient hospitals or outpatient surgical facilities) who also received out-of-network provider claims on the day of the surgery or out-of-network surgical pathology services performed on a different date. We found that 21% of women undergoing mastectomies experienced out-of-network provider charges, including surgical pathology charges; for 15% of women, the out-of-network charges were billed on the day or during the inpatient stay of their surgery.",
            "While potential surprise bills are relatively common, in general, patients with serious or complex conditions may be even more likely to face such charges, depending on the types of services they need and providers they encounter. As this analysis shows, admissions at in-network hospitals for maternity and newborn led to an out-of-network bill about 10% of the time, compared to almost a quarter of admissions involving a heart attack. The higher likelihood of surprise out-of-network medical bills, in turn, increases a patient’s financial exposure. While a person giving birth usually has more time to prepare and presumably plan for in-network provider use than a person having a heart attack would, one in ten maternity-related admissions at in-network hospitals still led to an out-of-network charge. The nature of surprise medical bills is that they cannot be reasonably prevented through planning.",
            "We analyzed a sample of medical claims obtained from the 2017 IBM Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database, which contains claims information provided by large employer plans. We only included claims for people under the age of 65. This analysis used claims for almost 19 million people representing about 22% of the 86 million people in the large group market in 2017. Weights were applied to match counts in the Current Population Survey for enrollees at firms of one thousand or more workers by sex, age, state and whether the enrollee was a policyholder or dependent. Weights were trimmed at eight times the interquartile range. Our methods for defining out-of-network claims, in-network facilities and emergency room visits matches the procedure describedhere.We defined the type of admissions based on the classifications provided in the Marketscan database, similar to the approach usedhere, which classifies admissions into five categories: surgical; medical; childbirth and newborn; psychological and substance abuse; and, other.",
            "Episodes with heart attacks were defined as outpatient days or inpatient admissions in which enrollees received one of the following icd-10 diagnosis: I2101, I2102, I2109, I2111, I2119, I2121, I2129, I213, I214, I220, I221, I222, I228 or I229.",
            "Women with a mastectomy are defined as women who had claim for a mastectomy or partial mastectomy (CPT codes: 19301 through 19307) and surgical pathology (CPT codes: 88300 to 88309) during 2017. We examined whether these women had any out-of-network claim on any of the outpatient days in which they had a mastectomy or surgical pathology claim. Eighty-one percent of women in this group had a diagnosis of breast cancer (C50). Women who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of F640 or F641 at any point during the year were excluded. Twelve percent of this group had mastectomies on more than one day in the year. Fifty-nine percent of women with a mastectomy had one or two days with a surgical pathology claim in the year, less than one percent had more than six claims in 2017. In-network facilities are defined as either admissions in which a mastectomy was performed and all room and board charges were in network or outpatient days in which a mastectomy was performed and all facility fees were in network.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "ByRabah Kamal,Nisha Kurani,Marco Ramirez, andSelena GonzalesKaiser Family Foundation",
            "November 15, 2019",
            "In this collection of charts, we use a variety of data sources to explore trends in health outcomes, quality of care, and spending on treatment for people in the U.S. with diabetes and other endocrine disorders. In the U.S., diabetes is the most common endocrine disease and is associated with severe health complications such as vision loss, kidney failure, lower-extremity amputations, and heart disease. As the following charts show, the U.S. has seen a reduction in complications due to diabetes and improvement in disease management, but diagnosis rates and diabetes-related spending continue to grow.",
            "Total health spending and out-of-pocket costs are generally higher for people with diabetes than those without diabetes. Recently, theincreasing priceof some types of insulin has drawn attention from both consumers and lawmakers concerned about insulin affordability for those who rely on it to survive. Complete data regarding these price changes — including discounts drug makers give to insurers and pharmacy benefits managers — are not publicly available. However, it is likely thatincreasesin net prices are lower thanincreasesin list pricesafter accountingfor these discounts. How changes in pricingaffect peoplewith diabetes depends on their source of coverage and plan design.",
            "Diabetes is among the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. Diabetes is a type of endocrine disease. Such diseases occur when any of the major glands in the endocrine system producetoo little or too muchof a particular hormone, or when the body responds irregularly to hormones. Diabetes, in particular, presents when the body is unable to properly regulate blood sugar levels.",
            "There are three main types of diabetes: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.",
            "The diabetes mortality rate in the U.S. rose by nearly 23% – from 23.9 to 29.3 deaths per 100,000 – between 1990 and 2002 and then decreased by 19% to 23.7 per 100,000 by 2010. Between 2010 and 2016, however, the U.S. mortality rate stopped declining and stayed around 24 deaths per 100,000 population. Meanwhile, in similarly wealthy countries, diabetes mortality decreased an average of 22% – from 19.6 to 15.2 deaths per 100,000 – between 1990 and 2016.Austria in particularhas higher than average rates of diabetes, which may contribute to the country’s diabetes mortality rate.",
            "In 2017, 7.2% of the population was diagnosed with diabetes, or 6.3% of the population when adjusted for age, which takes into account changes in age distribution. This marks a 188% increase from 1980 (and 125% when adjusted for age). Additionally, people who have diabetes may be undiagnosed for the condition. Currentestimatesfrom the CDC suggest that 30.3 million people in the U.S. (9.4% of the total population) have diabetes, including 23.1 million with a diagnosis and 7.2 million who are undiagnosed.",
            "In the U.S., diagnosed diabetes is most common among people ages 65 and older. From 1980 to 2017, there was an overall increase in the share of people with a diabetes diagnoses across all age groups. Although diabetes is less common at younger ages, the share of those 44 years old or younger with a diabetes diagnosis increased slightly between 1980 and 2017.",
            "In the U.S., the prevalence of diabetes has increased over time across all racial and ethnic groups and most rapidly among Asian and White people, but Black and Hispanic people continue to have the highest rates of diagnosed diabetes. In 2017, 6% of White people and nearly 7% of Asian people had a diabetes diagnosis, compared to over 8% of Black people and over 9% of Hispanic people — well above the national average of 6% of the total population for all ages. From 1999 to 2017, the percentage of people with a diabetes diagnosis increased by 19% among Black people, 48% among Hispanic people, 62% among White people, and 97% among Asian people.",
            "About 1 in 5 (22%) of non-elderly adults with a diabetes diagnosis reported not taking medication in advance due to cost, compared to 1 in 10 (10%) adults without a diabetes diagnosis, and 15% of adults with pre- or borderline diabetes. Out of those with a diabetes diagnosis, lower-income adults (income below $50,000 per year) were more than twice as likely to report not taking medications as prescribed due to cost, compared with adults with incomes above $50,000 per year (29% vs. 11%). Similar shares of diabetics who take insulin and those who do not take insulin reported that cost was a barrier to taking medication as prescribed (25% and 23%, respectively).",
            "Diabetes is commonly treated with medication, which includes insulin injections and oral medication, among other treatment options. According to the CDC, while most adults with a diabetes diagnosis (81%)reportedusing either insulin or pills for diabetes management in 2016, nearly 1 in 5 adults with diabetes (19%) reported not using any diabetes medication. Additionally, nearly1 in 4(24.4%) adults with diabetes asked their doctor for a lower-cost medication.",
            "Among people with employer-sponsored insurance, those who either have diabetes or have a family member with diabetes covered by their health plan are more likely to postpone, delay, or skip treatment due to costs, compared to those without a diabetes diagnosis in the household. Those who either have diabetes themselves or have a family member with diabetes are also more likely to have used other tactics or alternatives to taking medication as prescribed because of the cost. For example, 30% of people with employer-sponsored coverage who have diabetes or have a family member with diabetes say they did not fill a prescription, cut pills in half, or skipped doses of a medicine because of the cost, compared to 17% of those without a diabetes diagnosis in the family. Additionally, in this coverage group, people with a diabetes diagnosis in the household are also more likely to rely on home remedies instead of going to the doctor, accept medications from other people, and purchase (or attempt to purchase) medications from outside the United States — all due to costs.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Quality of Care",
            "Across the board, people with employer-sponsored insurance who either have diabetes or have a family member with diabetes covered by their plan are more likely to express difficulty affording monthly health insurance premiums andout-of-pocket cost-sharing, including medical bills that must be paid before meeting their deductible, co-pays for treatment as well as prescription drugs, andsurprise medical bills. Overall, 58% of people with employer-sponsored coverage who either have diabetes themselves or have a family member with diabetes say they have had difficulty affording any type of healthcare or have any problems paying medical bills (including out-of-pocket payments), compared to 38% of those without a diabetes diagnosis in the household.",
            "People enrolled in large employer coverage who have diabetes face annual out-of-pockets costs more than double that of all enrollees with large employer coverage. Average annual out-of-pocket spending for all enrollees increased by approximately 124% from 2003 to 2017 (from $348 to $779). Meanwhile, among enrollees with a diabetes diagnosis, average annual out-of-pocket spending increased by 76% (from $1,128 to $1,989) for those with diabetes complications and by 66% (from $955 to $1,585) for those without complications.",
            "Compared to average annual spending for all enrollees with large employer coverage, spending is much higher for enrollees with a diabetes diagnosis. Average annual health spending for all enrollees grew by 108% from 2003 to 2017 (from $2,767 to $5,747). In that time, average annual spending increased 86% (from $12,137 to $22,532) for enrollees diagnosed with diabetes with health complications and 57% (from $9,443 to $14,850) for those diagnosed with diabetes without a health complication.",
            "In 2016, the U.S. spent approximately $77 billion on the treatment of diabetes, according to estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This represents 3.4% of total medical services spending on treatment of diseases and other medical conditions ($2.25 trillion).",
            "In 2016, diabetes and other endocrine diseases together accounted for 7% of total spending on medical conditions, at $159 billion. The top 6 medical condition-based spending categories (ill-defined conditions, and diseases of the circulatory system, musculoskeletal system, nervous system, respiratory system, and endocrine system) account for over half (59%) of all medical services spending by medical condition.",
            "Endocrine, nutritional, and metabolic diseases and immunity disorders – including diabetes –  accounted for 8% of medical services spending growth from 2000 to 2016. Diabetes alone accounted for 4.2% of total medical services expenditure growth. Overall, medical services expenditures grew by 66.6% between 2000 and 2016. Total spending in this chart factors in changes in prevalence of a medical condition as well as the price of medical services.",
            "Between 2000 and 2016, the average annual growth in per capita expenditures for diabetes was higher than the average growth in spending on all medical condition categories. In this analysis,spending is calculated for a particular medical condition or disease, rather than by service. Growth in spending on diabetes care over the period was driven by both increases in the number of people being treated for these conditions and increases in the costs of treatment.",
            "The annual cost to treat a case of diabetes rose 74% from 2000 to 2016 ($1,209 to $2,106). Per capita spending on diabetes increased 228% from 2000 to 2016 ($72 to $238). Overall, U.S. spending on treatments for endocrine diseases and other related nutritional and metabolic conditions increased 177% from 2000 to 2016 (from $177 to $491 per capita). During this time, U.S. spending on all medical conditions increased 118% between 2000 and 2016 (from $3,192 to $6,974 per capita).",
            "TheExpress Scripts 2018 Drug Trend Reportfinds that medications for diabetes were the second most costly therapy class drugs in 2018, ranked based on per-member-per-year (PMPY) spending. Spending on diabetes medications was $115 PMPY in 2018, second only to $174 PMPY spending on medications for inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis). While PMPY spending for most of the top five therapy classes is driven primarily by spending on specialty drugs, diabetes is the exception, with spending only on traditional drugs.",
            "About 4 in 10 (43.8%) adults with a diabetes diagnosis report that their health is fair or poor, compared to over 1 in 10 (13.9%) of adults without a diabetes diagnosis. While most (83.3%) adults report being in good or better health, that share is much lower for adults with a diabetes diagnosis (56.2%).",
            "Aside from mortality and diagnosis rates, another way to measure the effect diabetes has on health is to look at the burden of disease, which takes into account both years of life lost due to premature death as well as years of productive life lost to poor health or disability. Using a measure called Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation finds that diabetes and kidney diseases were the ninth leading cause of disease burden in the U.S. in 2017. For the diabetes and kidney disease category, the growth in age-standardized DALYs stems from increases in both years of life lost and years lived with disability.",
            "Between 1993 and 2015, the rate of hospitalizations among adults with diabetes rose by 32% for those hospitalized due to hyperglycemic crisis (from 20.1 to 26.6 hospitalizations per 1,000 adults) and 31% for diabetic ketoacidosis (from 19 to 24.9 hospitalizations per 1,000 adults). Meanwhile, the hospitalization rate improved by 45% for hypoglycemia (from 4.7 to 2.6 hospitalizations per 1,000 adults) and by 43% for major cardiovascular disease (from 83.3 to 47.3 hospitalizations per 1,000 adults).",
            "Hospitalizations for diabetes complications differ by age.Diabetic ketoacidosisis an acute, life-threatening condition caused by high blood sugar levels that persist for too long, leading to a build-up of acids in blood.Hyperglycemic crisisis caused by chronically high blood glucose levels and can lead to complications such as, stroke, heart attack, amputation, and kidney disease. Both complications occur most often for patients with type 1 diabetes, who also tend to be younger — thus, adults with diabetes between the ages 18-44 experience most hospitalizations for both diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic crisis. Meanwhile, those ages 75 and up are most likely to be hospitalized forhypoglycemia(very low blood sugar) or major cardiovascular disease. Preventive health care and management of risk factors are among the primary reasons for a decline in severe diabetes complications.",
            "Diabetes complications such as nerve damage and poor blood circulation can put patients at risk of lower limb amputation. Most diabetes-related lower extremity amputationsresult from foot sores, which can often be prevented with diabetes management and foot care. Although the rate of hospitalizations for such amputations has dropped over time, diabetes patients have increasingly been hospitalized for lower limb removal in recent years. According to the CDC, between 2009 and 2015, the rate of hospitalizations for lower extremity amputations among adults with diabetesincreased 55%(from 3.1 to 4.8 hospitalizations per 1,000). In that time, hospitalizations specifically for toe amputations among diabetes patients increased 69% (from 1.6 to 2.7 hospitalizations per 1,000).",

            "Infant mortality (the death of an infant within the first year of life) is a widely-reported indicator of population health. This chart collection highlights key infant mortality trends and demographic variation within the United States and also explores infant mortality rates in the U.S. compared to countries that are similarly wealthy and sizable (based on GDP and GDP per capita).",
            "Overall, the U.S. and comparable countries have seen a decrease in infant mortality rates in recent years, but the U.S. has been slower to improve its consistently higher average rate of infant deaths, and significant disparities exist within the U.S. Although these gaps are not very clearly understood (in part due to limited cross-national comparability and availability of data), we consider available data and recent research to highlight some of the better-understood factors contributing to the U.S.’s relatively high rates of infant death.",
            "Over the past decade, the United States has seen reduced infant mortality. From 2007 to 2017, the U.S. infant mortality rate dropped by 14 percent (from 6.75 to 5.79 infant deaths per 1,000 live births). Among infant deaths, neonatal deaths are those which occur up to 27 days after birth, whereas postneonatal deaths are those occurring when the infant is 28 to 364 days of age. While both neonatal and postneonatal death rates have declined (by 13 and 17 percent from 2007 to 2017, respectively), the larger share of infant deaths has consistently been neonatal deaths.",
            "While the majority of infant deaths in the U.S. occur less than 28 days after birth (the neonatal period), a substantial share occur 28 to 364 days after birth (the postneonatal period). In 2017, 66 percent of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal period, and 40 percent of all infant deaths occurred specifically within the first 24 hours of birth. About a third of infant deaths (34 percent) occurred in the postneonatal period.",
            "The U.S.’s overall infant mortality rate is 5.79 deaths per 1,000 live births, but infant mortality rates vary from state to state, with a concentration of high rates in the South and parts of the Midwest. At the state level, infant mortality ranges from a low of 3.66 deaths per 1,000 live births in Massachusetts to a high of 8.73 in Mississippi. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, eleven states have infant mortality ratessignificantly lowerthan the national rate (CA, CO, CT, ID, MA, MN, NH, NJ, NY, ND, and WA), and fifteen states and the District of Columbia had significantly higher rates (AL, AR, GA, IN, KY, LA, MD, MI, MS, NC, OH, OK, SC, SD, and TN).",
            "There are significant racial disparities in infant mortality rates in the United States. Non-Hispanic Black mothers experience thehighestinfant mortality rate among all racial and ethnic groups (10.97 infant deaths per 1,000 live births), as well as the highest rates ofpreterm birth(delivery before 37 weeks of gestation) andlow birth weight, both of which are leading causes of infant death. Mothers who are American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander also experience a higher than average infant mortality rate (9.21 and 7.64 deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively). The infant mortality rate among Hispanic mothers is similar to the national average (5.10 deaths per 1,000 live births), while rates among White and Asian mothers are lower than average (4.7 and 3.8 deaths per 1,000 lives births, respectively).",
            "Researchers have long considered a variety of complex factors in an effort to better understand racial disparities in infant mortality, including infant health; maternal demographics, health, and behavior; medical care before, during, and after birth; and home and social environments before and after birth. Studiesconsistently indicatethat socioeconomic disadvantage is linked to higher risk of adverse birth outcomes both in the U.S. and other highly industrialized countries, with substantial variation in how socioeconomic factors impact birth outcomes for different racial and ethnic groups.",
            "However, studies also increasingly note that socioeconomic disadvantages alonemay not fully accountfor why Black mothers and their infants face such a disparity in adverse maternal and infant health outcomes in the U.S., and researchers focusing on the substantial Black-White infant mortality gap have generally found that controlling for maternal background factors alsodoes not fully explainthe disparity. Notably, recent research exploring U.S. maternal and infant health disparities discussesstructural racismas a primary risk factor for African-American mothers and their infants, largely due to the complexstressit places on mothers throughout their life.",
            "Racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality exist in both the neonatal and postneonatal period. In 2017, neonatal mortality was highest among infants of non-Hispanic Black mothers (7.16 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to the national average of 3.85). Neonatal mortality was also above average among infants of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native mothers (4.77), was similar to the national average among infants born to both non-Hispanic Pacific Islander (3.82) and Hispanic (3.56) mothers, and was below average among infants born to White (3.04) and Asian (2.71) mothers.",
            "Postneonatal mortality was higher than the national average of 1.94 deaths per 1,000 live births for infants of non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native mothers (4.41), non-Hispanic Black mothers (3.82), and non-Hispanic Pacific Islander mothers (3.82).",
            "Infant mortality varies considerably based on maternal age. The rate of infant mortality is highest among mothers under age 20 (9.0 deaths per 1,000 live births) and lowest among mothers aged between 30-34 years old (4.8 deaths per 1,000 live births).",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "In 2017, 68 percent of all infant deaths in the U.S. were attributable to the 10 leading causes shown in the chart above. Congenital malformations were the underlying cause of 21 percent of infant deaths, and short gestation and low birth weight together accounted for 17 percent of infant deaths in the U.S.",
            "The primary causes of infant deaths vary by age of the infant at time of death. Within the first month after birth, short gestation and low birth weight are together the leading cause of neonatal mortality (at a rate of 0.95 deaths per 1,000 live births), followed by congenital malformations (0.87 deaths per 1,000 live births) and maternal complications (0.37 deaths per 1,000 live births). In the postneonatal period, the leading causes of death are congenital malformations complications (0.37 deaths per 1,000 live births, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and accidents (each accounting for about 0.3 deaths per 1,000 live births).",
            "The U.S. infant mortality rate (5.8 deaths under one year of age per 1,000 live births) is 71 percent higher than the comparable country average (3.4 deaths). Research indicatessocioeconomic inequalityin the U.S. is likely a primary contributor to its higher infant mortality, along with differential reporting methods. For example, arecent American Economic Journal studycompared U.S. infant mortality to that of Austria, Belgium, Finland, and the United Kingdom, concluding that data reporting differences may explain up to about 30 percent of the gap between the U.S. and these European countries. The study finds that higher postneonatal mortality in the U.S. accounts for 30 to 65 percent difference and suggests socioeconomic conditions among disadvantaged groups in the U.S. may account for most of its excess postneonatal mortality.",
            "When countries have different methods for reporting infant deaths, it is primarily a matter of how they report deaths among infants with very low odds of survival. According to the OECD, the United States and Canada register ahigher proportionof deaths among infants weighing under 500g, which inflates the infant mortality rate of these countries relative to several European countries that count infant deaths as those with a minimum gestation age of 22 weeks or a birth weight threshold of 500g.",
            "Our analysis of available OECD data for the U.S. and some similarly large and wealthy countries finds that when infant mortality is adjusted to include only those infant deaths that meet a minimum threshold of 22 weeks gestation or 500g in birth weight, the U.S. infant mortality rate is still higher than the average for those comparable countries with available data (4.9 vs 2.9 deaths per 1,000 live births). Without adjusting for data differences, the U.S. infant mortality rate appears to be 84 percent higher than the average for the same set of comparable countries. (Note that this comparison was limited to 2016 data and could not include data for Australia, Canada, and Germany, which are included in the previous chart’s comparable country average for 2017.)",
            "While differences in data collection likely explain some of the variance in infant mortality rates by country, this should not affect the relative rates of change over time, assuming data collection methods have not changed considerably. From 2000 to 2017, the infant mortality rate in the U.S. fell from 6.9 to 5.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, an improvement of 16 percent. Over the same period of time, the comparable country average improved by 26 percent, falling from 4.6 to 3.4 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
            "Relative to comparable countries on average, the U.S. has 63 percent more neonatal deaths (3.9 vs 2.4 deaths per 1,000 live births) and 90 percent more postneonatal deaths (1.9 vs 1.0 deaths per 1,000 live births).",
            "From 2000 to 2017, neonatal deaths (deaths less than a month after birth) decreased by 15 percent in the U.S. and by 23 percent in comparable countries. Cross-national data reporting differences may explain some of the U.S.’s apparently lagging improvement.",
            "Perinatal mortality rates, which reflect both early neonatal and some fetal deaths, are considered an indicator of the quality of antenatal and perinatal care. The U.S. perinatal mortality rate is similar to the average rate across comparable countries (6.0 and 5.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016, respectively) and relatively lower than the rate in some similarly wealthy countries. It is not clear if this variation reflects the quality of newborn care in the U.S., as international comparisons of perinatal mortality ratesrequire careful scrutinydue to differences in registration practices.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "ByGary Claxton,Daniel McDermott,Cynthia Cox,Julie Hudman,Rabah Kamal, andMatthew RaeTwitter",
            "September 25, 2019",
            "Collectively, employers are the largest purchaser of health care in the United States, providing benefits for over 153 million people.  There is considerable interest in how employers can use their purchasing power to improve quality and reduce cost in the healthcare system. Employer plans typically include plan networks, in which enrollees face lower out-of-pocket expenses if they receive care from a designated provider. By negotiating prices and establishing quality standards with providers participating in the network, employers can attempt to influence the cost and quality of care.  Although this may seem like an appealing strategy for employers, particularly large firms with significant buying power, many companies have not used the leverage of network participation aggressively. While networks can mitigate cost growth, there are considerable challenges to developing and promoting these strategies, including concerns that tighter networks may limit enrollee choice and potentially expose employees to out-of-network charges.",
            "This analysis includes an overview of strategies employers are implementing and offers a deeper understanding of the successes, barriers, and trade-offs firms have experienced in their network decision-making. This report combines data from the Kaiser Family Foundation’s (KFF)2019 Employer Health Benefits Surveywith findings from three focus groups with 25 human resources managers, held in collaboration with the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) and Human Resource Executive (HRE). There remains relatively modest uptake of several strategies to improve costs or quality through provider networks. Barriers to adoption include lack of awareness and information, the geographic distribution of employees, and concern over employee’s potential reaction to changes in provider options.",
            "Health plans face trade-offs in developing provider networks. Employees generallyvalue broader networksthat give them ample choice of providers and ensure that fewer employees lose their existing providers when transitioning to the plan. At the same time, health plans can ultimately bargain better prices or influence terms of practice only to the extent they are willing to exclude providers from the network. Finding ways to limit their network to more efficient and better quality providers, or to direct employees to choose those providers from within a broader network, are primary tools to influence cost and quality.  Health plans attempt to balance designing narrow enough networks that they can bargain with providers about the terms of participation, but broad enough that employers and employees are content with their choices.",
            "One way that plans have sought to balance the competing desires for broader networks and the use of more efficient, higher quality providers is by creating tiered networks. In a tiered network, the plan divides the providers in its network into two or more distinct groups, typically based on the cost effectiveness and/or quality of the care they provide. Enrollees that elect to use providers on more-preferred tiers typically face lower cost sharing than enrollees receiving care from less-preferred providers. Tiering may be used for all types of providers, or may be limited to select categories such as hospitals or specialists.  Most employers electing to contract with a plan with a tiered network say the selection of providers into tiers is based on both costs and quality.",
            "Our survey finds that only14% of firms with 50 or more workers say their largest health plan includes a tiered network, but the prevalence increases with firm size (31% of firms with 5,000 or more workers include a tiered network in their largest plan). Since 2010,there has been no changein the percentage of offering firms with 50 or more employers whose largest plan includes a tiered network. Even though tiered networks have beenshown to meaningfully reduce costsfor health plans and enrollees, providers who operate in concentrated markets or have been identified as “must haves”have significant leverage to resist contracting with carriers or employerslooking to tier providers.",
            "Health Spending",
            "Health & Wellbeing",
            "Most focus group participants had never considered implementing tiered networks in their health plans, and several had never heard of the concept. However, other participants who had adopted tiered networks appreciated that these plans encourage workers to use efficient providers without making it prohibitively expensive for those looking to avoid changing doctors.",
            "“We are trying to drive better outcomes, to get cost containment, and also to make sure our team members are getting the best care. We figured tiering would steer them towards better providers without making it unaffordable if they wanted to go to a doctor they already had a relationship with. So it’s $40 versus $20 if you go to the premium designated provider.”–Analyst, Large Food Services Firm",
            "Another, more aggressive strategy that plans use to direct enrollees to more cost-effective providers is to create a network that is restricted only to a limited number of providers that agree to meet relatively stringent cost and/or quality objectives.  These plans, often referred to as narrow network plans, have been found tosignificantly lower premiums and overall spending without necessarily harming access to care, even though fewer providers are covered. Narrow network plans are relatively common in the non-group market but have had limited adoption among employers, with only5% of employers offering a narrow networkplan in 2019.",
            "Similarly, only 7% of firms categorized the provider network in their largest plan as “Somewhat Narrow,” and less than 1% said their network was “Very Narrow.”",
            "None of the firms participating in the focus groups offered a narrow network plan, but some indicated an interest in doing so in the future. Participants who stated they were considering offering narrow network plans expressed a desire to offer their employees a choice between a skinnier network at a lower cost or a broader, more extensive network at a higher cost.  One issue raised by participants, however, is that insurance carriers did not necessarily offer narrow networks in all of the geographic areas where they had employees (this is discussed more below, in the section on barriers).",
            "“We’d like to offer a narrow network within the next few years once our carrier has expanded to more areas. We might offer one narrow network plan and one broader plan for those willing to go narrow.”–Analyst, Large Food Services Firm",
            "Firms can designate specific facilities as Centers of Excellence if they provide very high quality or low-cost care, often times for a particular service. Firms will then encourage workers to receive care for select procedures, such as transplants, at these facilities by offering significantly lower cost sharing than is otherwise available at their in-network hospitals. Some employers, particularly very large ones, have seendrastic reductions in unnecessary care and expensesafter adopting Centers of Excellence. According to the 2019 survey, 16% of firms with 50 or more workers designated facilities as Centers of Excellence. Of those firms, 19% further incentivized their workers to receive care at Centers of Excellence by offering to covered travel and lodging expenses.",
            "While some focus group participants worked for employers with Center of Excellence programs, others cited logistical challenges with incorporating them into their networks.",
            "“We may look at the Centers of Excellence, it’s just hard with such a spread out population.”–Analyst, Large Food Services Firm",
            "Some employers look beyond the network established by their health plan or administrator and contract directly with hospitals, health systems, or clinics to provide services for certain conditions. These arrangements are available to self-funded firms and are negotiated independent of their health plan. An employer may choose to contract directly with a provider or system of providers if it can negotiate a better deal or get better service than it would through its health plan network. An employer with a substantial number of employees may be able to negotiate for favorable prices, shared-risk arrangements, or may gain access to additional services or data. Amonglarge self-funded employers (200 or more employees), 8% had direct contracting arrangementsin 2019.",
            "Only a few focus group participants had successfully directly contracted with providers outside of their original networks. These participants said that they were primarily motivated by recommendations from their employees or their doctors.",
            "“We’ve advocated on behalf of our employees to add providers to the network. An employee needed a kidney transplant and the facility close to our employee’s home was very highly rated and out-of-network, and that’s where he wanted to go and felt like he could get the best treatment.”–Director, Large Manufacturing Firm",
            "“We are based in San Diego so we border with Mexico, and there is a clinic in Mexico offering alternatives for cancer treatment and several of our staff members had gone through there, and so we looked into partnering with them to offer that alternative to our staff.”­–Assistant Director, Large Entertainment Firm",
            "Conversely, employers may be able to improve the value of their health plan by working with their insurance carrier or plan administrator to remove facilities or practitioners with poor practice patterns or excessive rates from the plans’ network. To do this, employers need access to information about the cost and utilization of providers in their plan networks from their insurers or plan administrator.",
            "While it may seem that employers would be interested in dropping poorly performing hospitals or health systems from the networks serving their employees, it rarely happens. Fewer than 2% of firms offering health benefits reported that they or their insurer eliminated a hospital or health system from any of their provider networks in the past year to reduce plan costs. In fact, only 5% of firms that did not eliminate any specific providers from their network have even considered doing so.",
            "The vast majority of focus group participants said they never considered eliminating high cost or low value providers from their networks, and many didn’t know about this option. Among focus group participants, the only instance where a firm had taken steps to exclude a provider was precipitated by drastic price increases.",
            "“One of our local hospitals was purchased by a larger [health system] and their prices were [almost] double even though the hospital was still in-network. We looked at the cost and utilization at their clinics and our broker approached them and said, ‘hey, if you want their business you are going to bring down your prices.’ And they are negotiating.”–Director, Mid-Sized Education Services Firm",
            "Employers and health plans can increase access to services and potentially lower costs by extending their networks to include new types of service providers. In recent years, employers have covered services delivered at retail health clinics, worksite clinics such as those established by employers on or near a work site, and telemedicine services. In addition to being more convenient for workers, these alternative sites of care may also provide access to services at a lower cost than in physician offices or other more traditional settings.",
            "Retail health clinics, which are growing in popularity, are located in retail stores such as pharmacies (e.g., Walgreens, CVS), grocery stores or big-box stores (e.g. Walmart, Target). These clinics typically are staffed primarily by nurse practitioners or physicians assistants and are intended to provide non-emergency care, including preventative services such as vaccinations. Among firms with ten or more workers,82% cover health care services received at retail clinics, and of those, 16% provide a financial incentive to encourage enrollees to use a clinic rather than visit a traditional doctor’s office.",
            "Some larger employers establish clinics at or near their larger work sites, sometimes sharing the expense with other employers in the area. These clinics may treat workplace injuries or provide additional services to employees and their families.Twenty percent of employerswith 50 or more employees report that they had an on-site or near-site clinics at least one work site in 2019.",
            "Telemedicine is the provision of health care services through remote consultation, including the use of video chat or other telecommunications. Proponents of telemedicine believe that it can improve the value and efficiency of health care, for example by conveniently monitoring chronic conditions or triaging and managing non-emergency situations. It also has the potential to increase access to specialty care to areas with limited provider availability. Employers have embraced the concept, with the share of large employers whose plan with the largest enrollment covers telemedicine growing rapidly, from 27% in 2015, to 63% in 2017, and82% in 2019. Among employers with 50 or more employees that offer telemedicine services in their plans,48% use incentives, such as lower cost-sharing, to encourage the use of telemedicine. Although employers have been quick to embrace telemedicine’s potential, employees have been slow to respond:less than 1% ofenrollees in large employer plans used an outpatient telemedicine office visit in 2016.",
            "Due to time limitations, we didn’t discuss the use of retail or on-site/near-site clinics with the focus group participants. For telemedicine, focus group participants reported mixed results. Most participants expressed excitement about telemedicine’s potential advantages, especially for lower-wage workers who cannot afford the cost of a comprehensive health plan. Invariably though, all participants reported that utilization rates were low. Multiple firms participating in the focus groups actually dropped coverage for telemedicine because the low utilization rates did not justify the cost. Some focus group participants said their plans either charged the same cost-sharing or more for telemedicine services than in-person visits. However, focus group participants who charged lower cost sharing for telemedicine saw promising trends in the take-up rate.",
            "“We pulled in telemedicine too so that our employees can, for the common easy things, they don’t have to go to the ER which is a lot more expensive, and they are able to utilize something on their phone to diagnose a sore throat or whatever.”–Representative, Large Manufacturing Firm",
            "“The only option [our hourly employees] have is the Minimum Essential Coverage, and then telemedicine becomes critical in that because that’s where they are going to be able to get that routine office visit, those kind of immediate fixes without any costs, where under a MEC plan if they go to an urgent care they are going to burden that cost 100%.”–Manager, Mid-Sized Utilities Services Firm",
            "“We changed from $15 copays, and we offer it at $0 and it has like tripled the usage.”–Director, Mid-Sized Education Services Firm",
            "Health plans design their provider networks so that they have options that will be attractive to their employer clients. Those clients, in turn, are attentive to the needs and desires of their employees and their family members, as well as to the costs of the benefit plan. Health plans generally create multiple plan options, often with somewhat different networks, to accommodate the various ways that different employers balance those considerations.",
            "While the health policy literature often focuses on ways that health plans and employers can use networks to increase efficiency or reduce costs, employers have a more nuanced view when judging provider networks. When asked about the most important criteria for evaluating a provider network, roughly equal shares of small and large employers say the number of providers, the cost of providers, and the quality of providers.",
            "This balanced view makes sense because employers view health insurance as a valuable employee benefit that is important to attracting and retaining workers. While health benefits are clearly expensive and employers are always interested in ways to reduce costs, employers still need to balance potential cost savings against the risk of worker dissatisfaction. This is particularly important in the current tight labor market, where recruitment costs are high and there is a premium on retaining current employees. As some focus group participants noted, this also applies to firms recruiting workers in lower-wage industries.",
            "“We’ve had a few different brokers and it seems like there’s a push for financials being the number one factor. But for our organization we’re driving recruitment and retention with the benefit plans because pay is never going to be the highest. So it’s interesting to me because it seems like that is a carrot that is out there, but it is not a carrot for us.”–Director, Mid-Sized Educational Services Firm",
            "“We have several locations where we will start out with one to three employees and those locations aren’t necessarily going to grow to be really large. That’s why we want to make sure that we have a broad network as opposed to a narrow network, so we can say that ‘okay, you are going to have flexibility to likely go to your doctor.’ We look at costs, but when it comes to network we defer cost being the number one factor over network and the availability of network from a recruitment perspective.”–Director, Large Rental and Manufacturing Firm",
            "Viewed through this lens, it’s not surprising that strategies such as tiered or narrow networks, which have the greatest potential for employee disruption and dissatisfaction, have low adoption rates despite the potential to reduce costs or improve quality. Concerns about employee backlash and access and convenience for employees are among the most important obstacles identified by employers to adoption of a narrow network plan. In contrast, strategies that add provider options and have no downside for employees, such as telemedicine and retail health clinics, are widely adopted.",
            "Employers’ size and management resources also affect their ability and capacity to identify cost and quality issues and advocate for changes in health plan networks. Smaller and mid-sized employers generally must choose from network options offered by the insurers serving their areas. Larger employers will have more opportunity to customize their networks by working with their health plans and plan administrators, with the largest employers having the most leverage.  Options may be limited even for some very large employers, however, if their workforce is widely dispersed or includes numerous rural areas. Many smaller and mid-sized employers also lack the expertise or awareness to exercise authority over their health plans or providers in their network, and, as a result, are frequently reliant on brokers or third party administrators.  Even some employers that most would view as large may not have the internal capacity to engage meaningfully on network issues with their health plans and plan administrators. Thevast majorityof both small and larger employers use a broker or consultant to help them choose a health plan.",
            "For many focus group participants, brokerage firms played a large role in designing and evaluating provider networks. Some focus group participants indicated that their brokers helped negotiate with carriers and providers, or commonly sat in on discussions with the carrier to offer guidance. In general, there were mixed reviews about the effectiveness and quality of relationships that exist between firms and their brokers, but many focus group participants seemed to believe that they were powerless without them.",
            "“[With regards to eliminating providers] I don’t even think we knew to ask the question.”–Director, Large Rental and Manufacturing Firm",
            "“I was just texting our executive director right now saying, ‘wow I didn’t realize we have all of these extra options in terms of benefits because our broker, basically, once a year says ‘okay, these are your options.’”–Assistant Director, Large Entertainment Firm",
            "“I think that narrowing networks or cutting people from your networks is new to me because I always felt that we were at the whim of the provider, that if they are in the network they are good to go and that we didn’t have the ability to control that.”–HR Representative, Mid-Sized Hospitality Firm",
            "“We’ve met with [our broker] to say, we need the honeymoon phase back again. We are relying on you for this information. I’m an HR director, I’m not an expert in benefits, I try to be, but I also have to recruit and retain my talent, too. There’s other things I need to be doing.”–Director, Large Manufacturing and Wholesale Firm",
            "Focus group respondents also identified administrative challenges in implementing and communicating network changes. Tiered or narrow networks are challenging not only for employers to establish, but also for employees to navigate. It requires significant energy and sophistication to identify high-performing providers or networks, especially for firms that operate in multiple locations. On top of that, it is difficult to communicate changes in network design to a large workforce, detailing which providers are new or no longer covered. Human resource departments may not have the expertise or resources required to adopt sweeping network changes. Several focus group participants who had employees spread out across multiple states echoed these sentiments.",
            "“I don’t think we have thought about it because we have over 100 locations all across the U.S., so logistically it would be challenging to pick someone in each market.”–Manager, Large Manufacturing Firm",
            "“I know [our carrier] has the option out there to restrict certain hospitals in an area, but with us with over 1,000 employees spread out over the U.S., we wouldn’t look at it just because of a communication issue, to try to communicate who they can and can’t go to.”–Recruitment Specialist, Large Construction Firm",
            "“Engagement is really hard for us because we have a few hundred stores, there’s 100 employees at each one and none of them are in HR. So we are relying on the bookkeeper in the store to disseminate a lot of the information. A lot of our people don’t have email addresses and we have had internal push back on trying to get our employees’ mobile phone numbers. So we have morning huddles and things and we can keep pushing stuff but we don’t know if it’s being discussed.”–Analyst, Large Food Services Firm",
            "Even employers that want to push for network changes to improve quality or increase efficiency may not have the information they need to assess their current networks or the providers within them. Employers must have access to information about the performance of health systems or individual providers to determine whether including or excluding them will improve the value of their health plans. This information can come in various forms, including claims data or online tools that rank providers on cost or quality measures.",
            "Aside from the limited information on quality available in online tools designed for enrollees, focus group participants were generally unable to identify any quality information available to them. Focus group participants were more likely to receive rankings or metrics on providers’ cost or utilization rates rather than quality outcomes from their insurers or administrators. Some focus group participants reported that this cost and use information comes to them only during regularly scheduled reviews with carriers or brokers, but outside of these meetings, the firms have to request these metrics in order to receive them. Very few participants had independent access to the underlying data. Given the incompleteness of the rankings and reliance on brokers or carriers to analyze the underlying data, it would be very difficult for most focus group participants to construct a picture of how well a health system or network is performing.",
            "“[We] get a lot of data. We work with [a brokerage firm] so we get quite a bit of information and we do quarterly reviews…but I have never seen ‘How is this network performing as a whole,’ whether it’s an A,  B, or a C.”–Vice President, Large Consulting Firm",
            "“We have no visibility [with Carrier A], of any kind. We had [Carrier B] before but the problem was trying to get visibility into the other states because it’s patch worked. With [Carrier C] you can look up any doctor and see what their rates are and their outcomes.”–Analyst, Large Food Services Firm",
            "“We get a little bit of the utilization information from [Carrier A], but that has come with a lot of requesting and pushing and prodding. In our HSA plan [with Carrier B] we don’t get information into rates, but more utilization, and we also have had to do a lot of follow-up and a lot of requesting to get that. Without that we would not be getting anything.”–Manager, Large Transportation Firm",
            "Another challenge for health plans is ensuring they have networks that are large enough to serve employers with workers in multiple locations and in rural areas. Many areas have relatively few providers, leaving health plans in a weak position to bargain. Larger plans with multi-state networks have an advantage with employers looking for a single plan, but that may limit the number of options available in some places. The alternative for these employers is to contract with multiple health plans, which is administratively more complex.",
            "“We haven’t explored [tiered networks] because we have limited coverage as is in the areas we are in, so it’s hard to put something like that in place. We also only have one network and unfortunately, a lot of the communities that we serve and our employees are in are desolate. There may be one physician in that community. So that has been a real challenge, finding a network that actually works for all those communities.”–Director, Large Educational Services Firm",
            "“I’m in a very similar situation. We have one network to choose from, but it has to be someone who is able to be out in communities like that. Very, very rural areas that don’t accept everything.”–Representative, Large Management Firm",
            "Similarly, firms whose workforce is spread out over several sites may not be able to engage effectively on issues of network cost and quality because they do not have a sufficiently concentrated interest in the provider network serving any particular area. Their workforce location also may not line up with the areas where health plans have created alternatives such as tiered or narrow networks.",
            "Eleven percentof large firms report that the biggest barrier to adopting a narrow network is that their employees were spread out over a large area or multiple states. The vast majority of focus group participants had employees operating in multiple areas or states, making it difficult to push back on network composition in a focused way.",
            "“[With regards to direct contracting] I don’t know that we would have had the volume in a particular area to do so.”–Director, Large Staffing Agency",
            "“We have two major locations in the U.S. but we have employees spread out in nearly every state, and accessibility to network was a huge issue for us. We struggled with getting network coverage in our secondary state, where we have the second most group of employees. We put out to bid and we had companies that won’t even bid on our business because they can’t provide the network that we need.”–Director, Large Manufacturing Firm",
            "“So we have companies in the U.S. from New Jersey to California and with [Carrier A] we don’t have buying power. We are kind of stuck with [Carrier B], because it is almost 98% of our employees [that] have access to their networks.”–Director, Large Manufacturing and Wholesale Firm",
            "Many of the strategies outlined here have the potential to reduce cost and improve quality. While employers have generally adopted coverage for telemedicine and care at retail clinics, many of the strategies that require employers to become more active purchasers, such as direct contracting, developing narrow networks and eliminating providers, have relatively low rates of adoption. Many employers face limitations such as a lack of data, time and expertise to undertake these steps alone. Often times, especially for smaller and mid-sized employers, they are reliant on insurers and consultants to help design and monitor these programs.",
            "Even if firms have the buying power or resources to reconfigure their provider networks, they still face challenges in doing so. All of the network configuration approaches discussed above require difficult trade-offs between the cost, quality, and convenience of health care, decisions on which there is little consensus. On one hand, employers have obvious incentives to cut their health spending, but there is widespread concern over how workers would respond to changes or reductions in their health plan’s provider networks. While workers generally value broader networks, cost may be an increasingly important concern for at least some employee populations. According to arecent surveyconducted by KFF and theLos Angeles Times, workers report that cost (36%) has overtaken the choice of providers (20%) as the main reason they chose their health plan, essentially inverting the results from a similar KFF survey in 2003.",
            "Employers have sought to cut costs and ensure appropriate use of service through increased cost sharing and the use of utilization management programs, but the ability of employers to influence the prices of services depends in large part on their ability to negotiate those prices with providers. That has not happened on a large scale, possibly in part because unemployment has been low and employers have been attracting and retaining workers. It’s possible employers might turn more to network strategies if the labor market loosens, or if there is growing resistance to continued increases in deductibles as a strategy to constrain the cost of health benefits.",
            "The 2019 Employer Health Benefit Survey is a nationally representative survey of trends in benefit designs, offer rates, and costs of health plans offered by both small and large companies. This year, with support from the Peterson Center on Healthcare, KFF added several new questions to the survey to examine how employers make decisions around provider networks as a way of influencing costs/efficiency and improving quality. The 2019 survey included 2,012 interviews with nonfederal public and private firms. For more information on the employer health benefit survey, please visitwww.kff.org/ehbs.",
            "In addition to this year’s survey, we organized three focus groups at large human resource conferences, to explore how employers approach trade-offs between the cost, access, and quality of care for their employees. Two focus groups were conducted at the Society for Human Resource Management’s (SHMR) 2019 Annual Talent Conference held in Nashville, Tennessee. The third focus group was conducted at Human Resource Executive’s (HRE) 2019 Health Benefits Leadership Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.",
            "The authors would like to thank theSociety of Human Resource Management(SHRM) andHuman Resource Executive(HRE) for their assistance in organizing the focus group discussions.",
